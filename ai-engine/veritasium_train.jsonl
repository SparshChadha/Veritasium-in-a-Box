One day they could work in swarms, they could save yourlife, or even spy on you. We got access to the best microrobotics labs in the world. Whoo, that flipped. [Derek] To learnhow these robots work and what are they for. This video is sponsored by Onshape. This is a tiny yellow submarine. Under water, it can move around by flapping these miniaturewings nine times per second, but you can use those same wings when the submarine is out of the water, only now you have to flapthem 250 times a second to make it fly. So, this robot can do both. It can fly and swim, but since it weighs only 175 milligrams, about the mass of two Cheerios, surface tension is a problem. That's a consequence ofphysics at a smaller scale. The surface tension is like a wall that blocks the transition process. This happens because water molecules are slightly polar. Groups of these moleculespull in all directions, but at the surface there's no water above, so the pull is onlysideways and downwards. This imbalance createsstrong, cohesive forces that compress the surfaceinto a tightly packed layer, making it difficult to break. This is the same effect that lets water striders walk on the surfaces of ponds and lakes. This other robot weighs only 68 milligrams and by using a spring mechanismthat mimics a flea's leg, it can jump without breakingthe water's surface, just like a water strider. (upbeat music)(water bubbles) It's like there's solid ground below. (water bubbles) Now that's great if you wannastay on top of the water, but this barrier can also be a problem if you want to go underwater. To escape this trap, the submarine splits waterinto hydrogen and oxygen and then stores these gasesin a buoyancy chamber. It does this because thewings are super fragile. If they started flapping while the robot was still trapped under water,they would break right off. So, the buoyancy from the gashelps bring the fragile parts of the robot out of the water, but the robot is still stuck in that top layer of surface tension. So, a sparker inside thechamber ignites the gas, and the explosion breaksthe surface tension and shoots the robot 30centimeters into the air. And once it's free, this robot can fly. This robot found a different way to break through the surface tension. It uses these large waterrepellent copper pads on its feet to walk on the water, but when it needs to dive beneath, it applies 600 volts to those pads, which creates a positive charge that attracts water molecules to it and breaks the hydrophobic barrier, and that allows it to sink on command. (gentle music)(water gurgling) Then, once submerged,it can walk underwater. Both of these robots weremade by Dr. Kevin Chen at MIT. We're looking at the flight room, and this is where we do allof our flight experiment. As you can see, it hasmotion capture cameras. [Derek] This lab is one of the only places in the world where robots this small attempt flight. [Henry] Okay, so becausethis robot's so small, it is such low inertia, right? So, you're saying thatit could flip faster than any other drone in the world? Beyond 7,000 degrees per second. I mean, you can actually hit the button. You'd let me hit the button? Yeah, I'd love to. Ready?- Yep. Okay.- Three, two, one. (robot buzzing)(triumphant music) (group cheering) (defeated music)(robot buzzing) We know who's fault it is. (group laughing) [Derek] Getting theserobots flying is tough. I mean, they're the size of bees, so the internal mechanismshave to be even smaller, like the parts of a watch. Yep.(wing buzzes) You got that? [Derek] Componentshave to be precise to within five microns. That's a 10th the width of a human hair. In the summer, we have those very bigflies zipping by in the lab, and I was making the statement of, \"Oh, they're just showing off.\" (group laughing) [Henry] Take two. Three, two, one. (robot buzzes) Whoo! (gentle music) That flipped.- There we go. (group clapping) So these bots fly but not like birds. I mean, they don't soar. Instead, they have to usea whole lot more energy, flapping their wingshundreds of times per second. So why do they do that? Well, it comes down tothis scale phenomenon. Larger objects typicallyhave less surface area relative to their volume, and that's important. Let's just approximate a flyer by a cube. Let's say it's 10 centimeters on a side. Well then that would havea volume of 10 by 10 by 10, or a thousand cubic centimeters, and it would have an areaof 10 by 10 by six sides, 600 square centimeters. So the surface area to volumeratio would be 0.6 to one. But now imagine we havea much smaller flyer that is just one cubiccentimeter in volume. Well, its surface area is goingto be one by one times six. That is six square centimeters. So that's gonna be 10times the surface area to volume ratio. It's gonna have a surfacearea to volume ratio of six to one. Now why is that so important? Well, it's because dragdepends on surface area. So if you have more surface area to volume, well you're gonna have a lot more drag, and also, at that small scale, you'll be much lighterrelative to that drag. So you're not gonna have as much inertia, so you'll get pushedaround more by the air, so you can't just soarthrough it like a bird. And that's why bees and other insects flap their wings a lot. What they're doing isgenerating swirls of air above the top of the wing, and those vortices createlow-pressure zones. When combined with the highpressure below the wing, that is what generates lift. So they're pushed up intothat low pressure region by flapping their wings back and forth. This robot was inspired byseeds from a maple tree. (gentle music) Their unique shape createsthe same swirling vortices above the seed's leading edge, and as they fall, they spin and generatesurprisingly high lift. These seeds are still just falling, but if you add miniature electric rotors to the ends of each wingtip on this robot, then it can generate enough lift to fly. (gentle music)(robot whirring) But this robot isn't quite insect scale. It actually weighs about 50times more than the RoboBees in Kevin's lab. So to power something that small, you can't just use electric motors. I mean, the magnets and coilsdon't scale down effectively to such a small size. (gentle music) So to power the first RoboBees, they had wings driven by special crystals called piezoelectric crystals. By applying a voltage across the crystal, they contract slightly, but only around 0.1%, not nearly enough of adeflection to make a robot fly. So roboticists designed a chassis that mechanically amplifiesthe motion 30 times. If you then turn the voltage on and off 120 times per second, the RoboBee flaps its wings and flies. But there is a downsideto piezoelectric crystals, which is, they're fragile. Even a small impact to thewings and the crystal cracks, and the RoboBee stops working. So at MIT, they are buildingtheir RoboBees differently. They're so confident thatit will survive being dropped that they're gonna let methrow it off of a building. So, I mean, here we go. (robot dings) (laughing)Okay, we gotta go see it. Come on. (gentle music)(henry laughs) I mean, it looks pretty good. This is amazing. Like how does this thingsurvive? I have no idea. [Derek] Well, theserobots have a secret ingredient. So put into scale.- Okay. Zero it. [Derekr] Instead of usingpiezos to drive the wings, these bees use soft polymers. They effectively work like tiny muscles. Just drop it here. [Derek] They take a polymer and they coat each sidewith carbon nanotubes that creates two effectiveconducting plates. So if you apply oppositecharges to these plates, that pulls them together,stretching out the polymer. But if like charges are appliedto both plates, they repel, and so the polymer shrinks and if we roll up layerslike this into a tube, we can amplify the force they generate. It stretches up to 25% of its length. By cycling the voltagehundreds of times per second, these muscles drive the RoboBees wings. When you shrink down to smaller scale, your fly wing frequency goes up higher. So we are at the 400 hertz range. Which is right in betweena honeybee and a mosquito. Yes.(group laughs) [Derek] This flexiblemuscle can take bumps and scrapes and keep working, but if it's pierced by a needle, the carbon nanotubes get pulled in and then the plates touch, causing a short circuit thatrenders the muscle useless. But the scientists have evenfound a way around this. When high current is cycled, the carbon nanotubes thatare touching burn off and so the muscle self-heals. Kevin and his team even invented a process to perform laser surgery on the robot. You're creating smaller defect around a very, very big defect and then by isolating the small defect, you're using the small defectto isolate the big defect. So that was what we call the laser-assisted clearing process. One robot was reallytested to its limits. Its artificial muscle waspierced by cactus needles and hit by a laser beam(laser sizzling) and it could still fly, but these muscles are energy intensive and for robots at this scalethat have to be so light, there's no room for extra batteries. Luckily, there is anotherway to get around. [Henry] That's a jumping, flying robot. [Kevin] Yeah. (upbeat music) [Dr. Muller] This RoboBeeconserves energy by hopping. This tech was used on another drone at the City University of Hong Kong. Normally this drone canonly fly continuously for 6.3 minutes, but with the hopping attachment, it can keep moving for 50 minutes, nearly 10 times longer. (RoboBee buzzing) Scientists believe thiscould be even more effective in low-gravity, low-airresistance environments like Mars. So it would be perfect foran ingenuity version 2.0. But microrobots arealready being used today. (gentle music)(airplane whooshing) Every day planes completehundreds of thousands of flights and most of them havemultiple turbine engines. Now a crack in a turbinecan be catastrophic, so manufacturers inspectthem every 3000 flight cycles or 180 days, but inspections cost tensof thousands of dollars and can take a whole day. That's where this cockroach-inspiredrobot from earlier, HAMR, comes in. It's incredibly fast, it can run 10.5 body lengths per second. Speaking in relative terms, that's faster than ahorse, and it's versatile. Its special foot pads can apply a voltage to polarized metal surfaces, creating an oppositecharge underneath its feet and that's how it's ableto stick to metal surfaces, similar to a balloon sticking to a wall after you rub it on your hair. Rolls-Royce and Harvardare working to put HAMR inside of engines toinspect for turbine cracks even upside down. And since its mass is so small, adhesion forces are muchstronger relative to its weight. So HAMR can get into some tight spaces and that can be pretty useful. (sirens wailing)One of the first times that robots were deployedin an emergency situation was during the 9/11 searchfor survivors at Ground Zero. Unfortunately, they didn'tturn out to be that helpful. They were big and expensiveand they'd get stuck. Three different types inspectedeight sections of rubble, but none found survivors. So an ideal rescue robot should be able to navigate tight spaces, withstand damage and debris, operate across varied environments, and be inexpensive enoughto be replaced if destroyed. The material cost is actually quite low for making the robot. The human labor is high, but in terms of the material, right, couple of dollars per robot, but it's really not that much. Really?- Yes. So the idea is to deploy swarms of insect-sized microrobots to search for survivors in disaster zones. (dramatic music)(siren wailing) But I understand when I say swarm, you might get a little worried. I mean, swarms of miniature killer robots are straight out of dystopian sci-fi. Think the hunter-seeker from \"Dune\" or the killer robot beesfrom \"Black Mirror.\" You might be familiar with that like famous\"Black Mirror\" TV episode where all like the bees. Yeah, yeah.- Yeah. When that came out, everybody that I had evermet in my entire life sent me a text message and was like, \"Hey bro, you seen this?\" [Derek] But thisidea isn't so farfetched. In the early 2000s, bees were dying off. It's calledcolony collapse disorder. Congress is holding hearings, even the Vice President has been briefed. In fact, the wholeRoboBee project started with the goal of replacing the bees. Thankfully that idea didn't last long. Bees can do much better jobs in terms of pollination thanthose robots much more cheaply. To pollinate, you need a huge colony ofbees to do those effectively. Also, from an environmentalprotection perspective, I think it doesn't make sense to replace bees with robotics bees from a cost-effective perspective and also from theperspective of, you know, if you have so much money, why you making those beesthan protecting the real bees. Okay, so they won't replace the bees, but I can still easily imagine a world where these same robots that are supposed to help in a disaster are secretly being used to spy on me. (tense music)(robot buzzing) I mean, it's a bug that wouldliterally look like a bug. (shower water dripping)That's terrifying. Is there any fear from you about what they could beused for, like ethically? We really focus onthe fundamental science and solving the fun technical problems. And as a society in general, we all should think about collectively how to prevent those newtechnology from doing harm. But we're getting abit ahead of ourselves. I mean, most of the robots we've seen aren't able to spy on us. In fact, they're noteven fully autonomous. We have offboard sensingfrom those cameras, you have offboard power from those, and offboard computation. What you see today iseverything is offboard. But hopefully in five years, then we can combine both sensing autonomy and power autonomy, and that's the longer-term goal. That's awesome. Harvard's RoboBee hasmanaged short bursts of untethered autonomous flight. So it's fair to say we aren't that far off from robot insectsoperating freely around us. Still, there is a limit to how far these robotscan go on just batteries. Batteries need shieldingto prevent damage, short circuits, and leaks. And the thing is, asbatteries are scaled down, this shielding has to stayabout the same thickness. So that means smaller batteries become increasingly inefficient. And that's ignoring thatthe energy-to-weight ratio of batteries is just fundamentally lower than that of chemical fuels. At the insect scale,every milligram matters. We just said, like let'sjust sail past all of that and just use a video game cheat code and just power our robot with the smallest explosions possible and put two tiny internalcombustion engines on board it, and it works. (upbeat music)(robot tapping) And it sounds like a combustion engine, which is probably my favorite part of it. (robot tapping) [Dr. Muller] Cameron'spenny-sized engine runs on a constant streamof methane and oxygen. This is fed into a chamberwhere it's ignited by a spark and so it combusts,releasing a burst of energy. The hot gases rapidly expand, pushing against aflexible polymer membrane that acts like a piston. So the membrane moves as the piston and then instead of havingto, like, have any sort of elaborate systemthat brings it back down because it just naturally is elastic, it sort of has its own restoring force. That was our clever little innovation. As the membrane shrinks back, it vents the exhaust gases,allowing the cycle to repeat. (mechanism tapping) Despite the continuousflow of methane and oxygen, the fuel line never catches fire. That's because as explosions get smaller, their volume shrinks muchfaster than their surface area. This causes them to lose heat more quickly to their surroundings. In Cameron's robot, only a small amount ofgas burns at a time, so heat quickly escapesinto the fuel line, cooling the gas and stopping the flame fromtraveling back up the line. With just two of these combustion chambers on a little robot, one for the front legsand one for the back, Cameron can control its heading. You can actuate justone of the two sides at a given time if you want because both sides are operational. So if we spark in bothsides, it'll move straight. But if we just do one orthe other, it'll pivot. [Derek] And this robot is super powerful for its size. It weighs 1.6 grams, which is about as muchas a gummy bear weighs. (robot tapping) It can jump like two feetin the air approximately. It can carry 22 times its body weight, which is about what a cockroachor a lot of beetles can do. We'll be able to puta fuel tank, you know, microelectronics sensors,a camera battery, and still have weight left over to go, and this thing will still chug along. That's the future. That's the goal. Scientists have created robots that can do what some insects do and there are clearapplications for this work. But for these roboticists,these self-labeled misfits, that's not what it's all about. If it's about application, we should all like make a startup and try to like think about what we can do to make money, right? We think there are nice applications, like inspection and search and rescue, but I would say as a research lab, we are mostly driven by curiosity. I think that's a veryhonest answer. (laughs) (quirky electronic music) So cool. If you are someone who designs hardware likethese robots, mini or mighty, you know that you need tocreate a CAD model first so you can prototype andbring your ideas to life. But the problem with mostmainstream CAD software is you need a very powerfulcomputer and a mighty budget. That's why we reached outto today's sponsor, Onshape.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: Europa Clipper mission and the scientific reasons why Jupiter's moon Europa is considered a strong candidate for finding alien life within our solar system"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's called \"2010, Odyssey Two.\" And at the end of it, an alien intelligenceconverts Jupiter into a star. As a group of astronautsnarrowly escape the implosion, they receive the followingmessage from the aliens, \"All these worlds areyours, except Europa, attempt no landing there.\" Now that was just a novel, but it suggests that already in 1982, we suspected that Europamight offer our best chance of finding alien life in the solar system. 42 years later, in October 2024, NASA is actually launchingthe most advanced mission to hunt for signs of alien life. And it's going to Jupiter's moon Europa. There's just one problem, Jupiter kills everything around it. So how could life exist there? And how do you make a probe that can withstand theperilous conditions? (suspenseful music) (gentle music)Deep inside Jupiter, there is so much pressure, that hydrogen is believed to take the form of a metallic liquid. And this metallic liquidhydrogen generates an incredibly powerful magnetic field, almost 20,000 times stronger than Earth, if you measure at the same distance away. So if you could see thismagnetic field from Earth, it would appear twiceas big as the full moon. On its own, that magneticfield is harmless. But right in the middle of it is the most volcanically activeworld in the solar system, Jupiter's moon, Io. The volcanoes on Io'ssurface shoot out tons of sulfur dioxide, and every second, one ton of this material gets ionized and trapped insideJupiter's magnetic field. And the field accelerates these particles to rotate incredibly fast with Jupiter. So they whizz around at over300 kilometers per second. Their inertia actuallypulls back on the field, stretching it out. And this trapped materialslams into other moons, ejecting even more particlesfrom their surfaces. This cycle forms massive radiation belts which span past Europa andthe other moons of Jupiter. Now, for electronics, thisintense radiation is kryptonite. In the 1970s, the Pioneer10 and Voyager missions only briefly passed by Jupiter, but the radiation caused glitches, gave the instruments false commands, and corrupted some of their data. Even with modern shielding, a spacecraft within the radiation belts would only survive foraround three months. So how will NASA's newmission, the Europa Clipper, orbit Europa for over fouryears without getting fried? Well, the solution is, it won't. It'll orbit Jupiter from afar and then swoop in every fewweeks to quickly fly by Europa and then leave again. And since the mission is goingto collect a lot of data, it can use the downtimewhile it's way out here to transmit it all back to Earth before going in for another swoop. In all, it'll do 49 flybys, mapping almost the entire surface. That's actually how theClipper got its name, after the fast and nimble19th century Clipper ships, quickly dipping in and out of ports. But of all the places in the solar system to look for life, why Europa? If you stood on Europa's surface, you'd be hit with 5,400 milliSieverts of radiation in a single day. That's 1,800 times more thanthe annual dose here on Earth. If you stay here for a couple of hours, you would eventually diefrom radiation sickness. But Europa contains a secret. When Voyager 1 passed by Jupiter in 1979, it took this photo of Europa. If you compare it tomost of the other moons in the solar system, you'll notice somethingis missing, craters. Every planet and moon has been bombarded by asteroids over billions of years. And most planetary surfaces show it. But not Europa. So why not? Well, something recent, say over the last 60 million years or so, must have been happening on Europa to erase most of thesecraters from the surface. 16 years after Voyager,Galileo arrived to Jupiter. It spent eight yearsstudying both the gas giant and its moons. And Galileo's magnetometer picked up something interesting on Europa. Jupiter's magnetic poles, like Earth's, aren't aligned with its geographic poles. So as the planet rotates every 10 hours, the whole magnetic field wobbles. This changing field from Jupiter induces a magnetic field on Europa, and a relatively strong one at that. That means there must be anelectrically conductive layer within Europa that reactsto Jupiter's field. And readings from Galileo indicate that it must be somewhereclose to the surface, only 10s of kilometers deep. So what kind of conductive layer? Well, Europa's white surfaceis almost entirely covered in a thick crust of water ice. These reddish-brown regions, when observed through a spectrometer, fit the description of a lotof things, like hydrated salts, sulfuric acid or even bacteria. We need more data to be sure, but recent experiments atJPL found that sea salt when bombarded with intense radiation, turns from white to this same brownishcolor found on Europa. So scientists suspect that there's a wholesaltwater ocean inside Europa that could be 100 kilometers deep. Meaning that Europa wouldcontain twice as much water as the whole of the Earth. And it must driving geological activity that constantly smooths out and renews the surface of the moon. But the Jupiter system only gets about 4% of the sunlight we get here on Earth. So Europa's surface is constantlybelow -160 deg Celsius, so you'd expect theocean to be frozen solid. But there's a way to generate heat that doesn't rely on the Sun. And I've got a littledemo here to prove it. Europa's orbit around Jupiterisn't a perfect circle. This is because Io, Europa and Ganymede are in orbital resonance. Each time Ganymede completes one orbit, Europa completes two and Io four. Because of that, Io tugs Europa inward on one side of the orbit, while Ganymede pulls it out on the other, making its orbit more eccentric. Now, Jupiter's pull is stronger on the closer side of theorbit than on the farther side. So Europa is constantlybeing stretched and squeezed, stretched and squeezed. And you can see how thisrubber ball gets warmer as I squeeze it. Scientists believe thatthe friction caused by the tidal flexing of the entire moon can generate enough heatto keep the ocean liquid. This effect gets stronger thecloser you are to Jupiter, which is why Io is so volcanically active. So you can see this ball issignificantly hotter now. I held onto this ball at the same time to make sure that it wasn'tjust the heat coming in from my hand. What sort of temperature ofthe ocean are we thinking? So it depends on how salty it is. So, melting temperature of ice or maybe depressed by 10degrees Celsius below that if it's a very salty ocean. Similar to cold oceans on Earth. And how would the flexing differ if there's this big liquid ocean versus if there's no ocean there? If there's no ocean, Europa should flex by only about one meter in amplitude. But if there's an ocean in there, then it flexes with anamplitude of 30 meters. So that's an enormous deflection. And that will come out prettyclearly in the gravity data. Another argument for howthick the ice shell is, we see these very strangefeatures on the surface that are arcuate in shape, but like multiple arcs put together. We call them cycloids. Not something you'd expectto see on an icy moon. And we think they formif a crack propagates at just the right speed, aboutthe speed someone would walk, and is following the changing stress field of Europa being squeezed asit orbits around Jupiter. And if there were no ocean down there, there wouldn't be enough ofan amplitude of that motion to explain the cracking. But if there is an ocean, then it could explain the cracking. All that tidal flexing pushesmagma in the outer core up, closer to the seafloor. Water flowing through thecrust above it is heated and it picks up minerals from the ground, ejecting them into the ocean. This creates hydrothermal vents. And where we find these onEarth, we also find life. Thousands of meters below thesurface, with no sunlight, these vents are oases for ocean life. The lifeforms down hererely on unique bacteria, bacteria that feed on theminerals from the vents, rather than on the energyprovided by the Sun. How long are we thinkingthat Europa has had an ocean? It could be four billionyears, we don't know for sure. That amount of time couldgive life the opportunity to evolve in those oceans? Right, exactly right. Organisms can use methane,carbon dioxide, sulfur reactions. Any chemical reaction you can think of that might happen in theocean can potentially be used as a fuel for that organism's metabolism. So we're not talking aboutsearching for fishes, or whales or squids orsomething down there, but looking for single cell organisms. We were so concerned theremight be life on Europa that, when the Galileo missionwas ending in 2003, it was deliberately crashed into Jupiter to avoid the risk of contaminating Europa. But Clipper will not be able to drill through thekilometers-thick ice crust. So how are we going to find evidence for life beneath that thick surface? This is the SnotBot. It's a drone with Petridishes glued to the top, and it flies right through whale blows to collect whale snot right here on Earth. And zoologists can use the SnotBot to retrieve all sorts ofinfo on a whale's biology. And it turns we can dosomething very similar for celestial bodies too. We've actually captured images of water geysers shootingout of Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, housinga subsurface ocean. And the Hubble space telescopehas picked up some evidence of what could be similargeyser eruptions on Europa. The hope is that Clippercould fly through one of these plumes, like the SnotBot, and reveal their chemical composition using a mass spectrometer. But evidence for an oceanon Europa isn't conclusive. Enceladus seems like a stronger candidate, we have actual images of its plumes and we've even flown through them. We are almost 100% certainthere's a subsurface ocean there. If we have these plumes on Enceladus and there's clearly maybea liquid ocean there, why does Europa have yourattention more than Enceladus? Is there something that draws you? We don't know how longit takes life to get going, but it's possible that Enceladus may have just kind ofstarted up its engines, whereas Europa has morelikely been well evolved over a long time. Surprisingly, being bombardedby Jupiter's radiation actually makes Europa a better candidate. See, those high-speed particleshitting Europa's surface give water and carbon dioxidemolecules enough energy to form new compounds, like formaldehyde or hydrogen peroxide. And these can serve as foodfor life beneath the surface, if they can get down that far. And we have evidence ofoverturn of the icy shell at chaos zones where the icycrust seems to have collided and material has beenshoved into the icy shell. So there may be waysfor this fuel for life to get down into the icy shelland potentially to the ocean. [Derek] And Clipperdoesn't have to touch down on the surface to confirm this. There's an infrared spectrometer to look at the chemical fingerprints of light bounced off thesurface to help identify and map out where the salts are, find if there are organics there. There is an ultraviolet spectrograph that's aboard the spacecraftto look for plumes. Are they there? And of course, then canwe fly through them? And then there'll be imagingof essentially the whole globe at better than 100 metersper pixel resolution. So one camera will take swaths of images as we fly over the surface and that's called the wide angle camera. And then the other camerais the narrow angle camera. From 50 kilometers altitude, it will get half meterper pixel images, right? So it'll be able to resolve my desk here if it were on Europa. And then it would be a future mission, like a lander that would go and actually search forsigns of life on Europa. Do you think a lander wouldhave a chance of survival? There have been studies that say we can get a lander living on the surface for a month. If we think that'ssufficient to go in there, scoop some stuff up from below the depth of radiation processing, and put it into a massspectrometer and see what we see. But the Europa Clipper won't be studying Jupiter's moons alone. The European Space Agency's JUICE mission, or the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer, is already on its way to Jupiter. It will come to the systemjust 15 months after Clipper and it'll even be doinga few flybys of Europa, before settling into atight orbit around Ganymede. So the European Space Agency will also have a missionthere at the same time? Yes, we're having informal conversations with members of the JUICE science team. What would it mean tohave two spacecraft there at the same time? The JUICE mission will endup in orbit around Ganymede and Ganymede has its own magnetosphere. Well, we'll be outsideGanymede's magnetosphere. So we might say, \"Oh, look, there's this big burstcoming from Jupiter.\" And then JUICE might say, \"Oh, we felt that over herein our magnetic signals.\" So we wouldn't have toreally do anything different except talk to each other and make sure that the sum of the whole is even bigger than its parts. Europa Clipper was scheduled to launch on October 10, 2024, but NASA is waiting forHurricane Milton to clear Florida before the spacecraft can take off safely. When will we get the first results? You'll start seeing distantobservations coming in in 2030 as we look at Europa fromafar and search for plumes. And then you'll see the firstreally high resolution data in 2031. So after say 26 years of thinking about a mission to Europa, how does it feel to be so close to launch? It's a little surreal,(laughs) I must say. This has been such a long time coming. It's occasionally hittingme that our spacecraft is going to be up there in theheavens, right, on its way. It turns out that, during a Europa Ocean Conference in the late 1990s, NASA actually video-calledArthur C. Clarke. And after showing him plansfor a future mission to explore the faraway ocean world, Clarke finally gave NASApermission to land on Europa. (monitor whooshing) Europa Clipper is a perfect example of the amazing things we can do when we set ourselves ambitious goals and work together withothers to achieve them. But I think we often getwrapped up in our everyday lives and forget just how much of an impact we can make on the world.

How much uranium does it take to build a nuclear bomb? How could you predict the next word in a sentence? And how does Google know which page you're actually searching for? Well, the reason we know the answer to all of these questions is because of a strange math feud in Russia that took place over a hundred years ago. In 1905, socialist groups all across Russia rose up against the Tsar, the ruler of the empire. They demanded a complete political reform, or, failing that, that he step down from power entirely. This divided the nation into two. So on one side you got the Tsarists, right? They wanted to defend the status quo and keep the Tsar in power. But then on the other side, you have the socialists who wanted this complete political reform. And this division was so bad that it crept into every part of society, to the point where even mathematicians started picking sides. On the side of the Tsar was Pavel Nekrasov, unofficially called the Tsar of Probability. Nekrasov was a deeply religious and powerful man, and he used his status to argue that math could be used to explain free will and the will of God. His intellectual nemesis on the socialist side was Andrey Markov. Also known as Andrey the Furious. Markov was an atheist and he had no patience for people who were being unrigorous. Something he considered Nekrasov to be. Because in his eyes, math had nothing to do with free will or religion. So he publicly criticized Nekrasov's work, listing it among the abuses of mathematics. Their feud centered on the main idea people had used to do probability for the last 200 years. And we can illustrate this with a simple coin flip. When I flip the coin 10 times, I get 6 times heads and 4 times tails, which is obviously not the 50:50 you'd expect. But if I keep flipping the coin, then at first the ratio jumps all over the place. But after a large number flips, we see that it slowly settles down and approaches 50:50. And in this case after 100 flips we end up on 51 heads and 49 tails, which is almost exactly what you would expect. This behavior that the average outcome gets closer and closer to the expected value as you run more and more independent trials is known as the law of large numbers. It was first proven by Jacob Bernoulli in 1713 and it was the key concept at the heart of probability theory right up until Markov and Nekrasov But Bernoulli only proved that it worked for independent events, like a fair coin flip, or when you ask people to guess how much they think an item is worth, where one event doesn't influence the others. But now imagine that instead of asking each person to submit their guess individually, you ask people to shout out their answer in public. Well, in this case, the first person might think it's an extraordinarily valuable item and say it's worth around $2,000. But now all the other people in the room are influenced by this value and so their guesses have become dependent. And now the average doesn't converge to the true value, but instead it clusters around a higher amount. And so for 200 years, probability had relied on this key assumption, that you need independence to observe the law of large numbers. And this was the idea that sparked Nekrasov and Markov's feud. See, Nekrasov agreed with Bernoulli that you need independence to get the law of large numbers, but he took it one step further. He said, if you see the law large numbers, you can infer that the underlying events must be independent. Take this table of Belgian marriages from 1841 to 1845. Now, you see that every year the average is about 29,000. And so it seems like the values converge and therefore that they follow the law of large numbers. And when Nekrasov looked at other social statistics like crime rates and birth rates, he noticed a similar pattern. But now think about where all this data is coming from. It's coming from decisions to get married, decisions to commit crimes, and decisions to have babies, at least for the most part. So, Nekrasov reasoned that because these statistics follow the law of large numbers, the decisions causing them must be independent. In other words, he argued that they must be acts of free will. So to him, free will wasn't just something philosophical. It was something you could measure. It was scientific. No text But to Markov, Nekrasov was delusional. He thought it was absurd to link mathematical independence to free will. So Markov set out to prove that dependent events could also follow the law of large numbers, and that you can still do probability with dependent events. To do this, he needed something where one event clearly depended on what came before. And he got the idea that this is what happens in text. Whether your next letter is a consonant or a vowel depends heavily on what the current letter is. So to test this, Markov turned to a poem at the heart of Russian literature. Eugene Onegin by Alexander Pushkin. He took the first 20,000 letters of the poem, stripped out all punctuation and spaces, and pushed them together into one long string of characters. He counted the letters and found that 43% were vowels and 57% were consonants. Then Markov broke the string into overlapping pairs. That gave him four possible combinations. Vowel-vowel, consonant-consonant, vowel-consonant, or consonant-vowel. Now if the letters were independent, the probability of a vowel-vowel pair would just be the probability of a vowel twice, which is about 0.18, or an 18% chance. But when Markov actually counted, he found vowel-vowel pairs only show up 6% of the time, way less than if they were independent. And when he checked the other pairs, he found that all actual values differed greatly from what the independent case would predict. So Markov had shown that the letters were dependent. And to beat Nekrasov, all he needed to do now was show that these letters still followed the law of large numbers. So he created a prediction machine of sorts. He started by drawing two circles, one for a vowel and one for consonant. These were his states. Now, say you're at a vowel, then the next letter could either be a vowel or a consonant. So he drew two arrows to represent these transitions. But, what are these transition probabilities? Well, Markov knew that if you pick a random starting point, there is a 43% chance that it'll be a vowel. He also knew that vowel-vowel pairs occur about 6% of the time. So to find the probability of going from a vowel to another vowel, he divided .06 by .43 to find a transition probability of about 13%. And since there is a 100% chance that another letter comes next, all the arrows going from the same state need to add up to one, so the chance of going to a consonant is 1 minus 0.13 or 87%. He repeated this process for the consonants to complete his predictive machine. So let's see how it works. We'll start at a vowel. Next we generate a random number between 0 and 1. If it's below 0.13, we get another vowel. If it's above, we get a consonant. We got 0.78, so we get a consonant. Then we generate another number and check if it's above or below 0.67, 0.21, so we get a vowel. Now we can keep doing this and keep track of the ratio of vowels to consonants. At first, the ratio jumps all over the place, but after a while, it converges to a steady value. 43% vowels and 57% consonants, the exact split Markov had counted by hand. So Markov had built a dependent system, a literal chain of events, and he showed that it still followed the law of large numbers, which meant that observing convergence in social statistics didn't prove that the underlying decisions were independent. In other words, those statistics don't prove free will at all. Markov had shattered Nekrasov's argument, and he knew it. So he ended his paper with one final dig at his rival. Thus, free will is not necessary to do probability. In fact, independence isn't even necessary to do probability. With this Markov chain, as it came to be known, he found a way to do probability with dependent events. This should have been a huge breakthrough because in the real world, almost everything is dependent on something else. I mean, the weather tomorrow depends on the conditions today. How a disease spreads depends on who's infected right now and the behavior of particles depends on the behavior of particles around them. Many of these processes could be modeled using Markov chains. Did people think it was like a mic drop moment, like, oh, Nekrasov is out, like Markov's the man, or people didn't really notice, or it was obscure, or? I feel like people didn't really notice, it wasn't a really big thing. And Markov himself seemingly didn't care much about how it might be applied to practical events. He wrote, I am concerned only with questions of pure analysis. I refer to the question of the applicability with indifference. No text Little did he know that this new form of probability theory would soon play a major role in one of the most important developments of the 20th century. On the morning of the 16th of July, 1945, the United States detonated 'The Gadget', the world's first nuclear bomb. The 6-kilogram plutonium bomb created an explosion that was equivalent to nearly 25,000 tons of TNT. This was the culmination of the top-secret Manhattan Project, a three-year-long effort by some of the smartest people alive, including people like J. Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann. And a little-known mathematician named Stanislaw Ulam. Even after the war ended, Ulam continued trying to figure out how neutrons behave inside a nuclear bomb. Now, a nuclear bomb works something like this. Say you have a core of Uranium 235. Then when a neutron hits a U-235 nucleus, the nucleus splits, releasing energy and crucially two or three more neutrons. If on average those new neutrons go on to hit and split more than one other U-235 nucleus, you get a runaway chain reaction. So you have a nuclear bomb. But uranium-235, the fissile fuel needed for the bombs, was really hard to get. So one of the key questions was, just how much of it do you need to build a bomb? And this is why Ulam wanted to understand how the neutrons behaved. But then, in January of 1946, everything came to a halt. Ulam was struck by a sudden and severe case of encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain that nearly killed him. His recovery was long and slow, with Ulam spending most of his time in bed. To pass the time, he played a simple card game, Solitaire. But as he played countless games, winning some, losing others, one question kept nagging at him. What are the chances that a randomly shuffled game of Solitaire could be won? It was a deceivingly difficult problem to solve. Ulam played with all 52 cards, where each arrangement created a unique game. So the total number of possible games was 52 factorial. Or about 8 times 10 to the 67. So, solving this analytically was hopeless. But then, Ulam had a flash of insight. What if I just play hundreds of games and count how many could be won? That would give him some sort of statistical approximation of the answer. Back at Los Alamos, the remaining scientists grappled with much harder problems than Solitaire, No text like figuring out how neutrons behave inside a nuclear core. In a nuclear core, there are trillions and trillions of neutrons all interacting with their surroundings. So the number of possible outcomes is immense and computing it directly seemed impossible. But when Ulam returned to work, he had a sudden revelation. What if we could simulate these systems by generating lots of random outcomes, like I did with Solitaire? He shared this idea with von Neumann, who immediately recognized its power, but also spotted a key problem. See, in Solitaire, each game is independent. How the cards are dealt in one game have no effect on the next. But neutrons aren't like that. A neutron's behavior depends on where it is and what it has done before. So you couldn't just sample random outcomes like in Solitaire. Instead, you needed to model a whole chain of events where each step influenced the next, what Von Neumann realized is that you needed a Markov chain. So they made one, and a much simplified version of it works something like this. Now, the starting state is just a neutron traveling through the core. And from there, three things can happen. It can scatter off an atom and keep traveling. So that gives you an arrow going back to itself. It can leave the system or get absorbed by a non-fissile material, in which case it no longer takes part in the chain reaction, and so it ends its Markov Chain. Or it can strike another uranium-235 atom, triggering a fission event and releasing two or three more neutrons that then start their own chains. But in this chain the transition probabilities aren't fixed. They depend on things like the neutron's position, velocity and energy, as well as the overall configuration and mass of uranium. So a fast moving neutron might have a 30% chance to scatter, 50% chance be absorbed or leave, and a 20% chance to cause fission. But a slower-moving neutron would have different probabilities. Next, they ran this chain on the world's first electronic computer, the ENIAC. The computer started by randomly generating a neutron's starting conditions and stepped through the chain to keep track of how many neutrons were produced on average per run, known as the multiplication factor k. So, if on average one neutron produces another two neutrons, then k is equal to 2. And if on average every 2 neutrons produce 3 neutrons, then k is equal to 3 over 2 and so on. Then, after stepping through the full chain for a specified number of steps, we collect the average k-value and record that number in a histogram. This process was then repeated hundreds of times and the results tallied up, giving you a statistical distribution of the outcome. If you find that in most cases k is less than 1, the reaction dies down. If it's equal to 1, there's a self-sustaining chain reaction, but it doesn't grow. And if k is larger than 1 the reaction grows exponentially and you've got a bomb. With it, von Neumann and Ulam had a statistical way to figure out how many neutrons were produced without having to do any exact calculations. In other words, they could approximate differential equations that were too hard to solve analytically. All that was needed was a name for the new method. Now Ulam's uncle was a gambler, and the random sampling and high stakes reminded Ulam of the Monte Carlo casino in Monaco. No text And the name stuck. The Monte Carlo method was born. The method was so successful that it didn't stay secret for long. By the end of 1948, scientists at another lab, Argonne in Chicago, used it to study nuclear reactor designs. And from there, the idea spread quickly. Ulam later remarked, It is still an unending source of surprise for me to see how a few scribbles on a blackboard could change the course of human affairs. And it wouldn't be the last time a Markov chain-based method changed the course of human affairs. No text In 1993, the internet was open to the public. And soon, it exploded. By the mid-1990s, thousands of new pages appeared every day, and that number was only growing. This created a new kind of problem. I mean, how do you find anything in this ever-expanding sea of information? In 1994, two Stanford PhD students, Jerry Yang and David Filo, founded the search engine Yahoo to address this issue. But they needed money. So, a year later, they arranged to meet with Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, also known as the Bill Gates of Japan. They were looking to raise $5 million for their new startup. But Son has other plans. He offers to invest a full $100 million instead. That's 20 times more than what the founders asked for. So Jerry Yang declines, saying, we don't need that much. But Son disagrees. Jerry, everyone needs $100 million. Before the founders get a chance to respond, Son jumps in again and asks, who are your biggest competitors? Excite and Lycos, the pair respond. Son orders his associate to write those names down, and then he says, if you don't let me invest in Yahoo, I will invest in one of them, and I'll kill you. See, Son had realized something. None of the leading search engines at the time had any superior technology. They didn't have a technological advantage over the others. They all just ranked pages by how often a search term appears on a given page. So the battle for the number one search engine would be decided by who could attract the most users, who could spend the most on marketing. And marketing required a lot of money, money that Son had, so he could decide who won the war. Yahoo's founders realized they were left with no real choice but to accept Son's investment. So here we are right in the middle of Yahoo. And within four years, Yahoo became the most popular site on the planet. In the time it takes to say this sentence, Yahoo will answer 79,000 information requests worldwide. The two men are now worth $120 million each. No text But Yahoo had a critical weakness. See, Yahoo's keyword search was easy to trick. To get your page ranked highly, you could just repeat keywords hundreds of times, hidden with white text on a white background. One thing they didn't have in those early days was a notion of quality of the result. So they had a notion of relevance saying, does this document talk about the thing that you're interested in? But there wasn't really a notion of which ones are better. What they really needed was a way to rank pages by both relevance and quality. But how do you measure the quality of a webpage? Well, to understand that, we need to borrow an idea from libraries. So I'm old enough that library books used to have a paper card in it that was a stamp of all the due dates of when it was due back. You took a book, and if it had a lot of those, you said, oh, this is probably a good book. And if it didn't have any, you say, well, maybe this isn't the best book. Stamps acted like endorsements. The more stamps, the better the book must be. And the same idea can be applied to the web. Over at Stanford, two PhD students, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, were working on this exact problem. Brin and Page realized that each link to a page can be thought of as an endorsement. And the more links a page sends out, the less valuable each vote becomes. So what they realized is that we can model the web as a Markov chain. To see how this works, imagine a toy internet with just four webpages. Call them Amy, Ben, Chris, and Dan. These are our states. Typically, one webpage links to others, allowing you to move between them. These are our transitions. In this setup, Amy only links to Ben, so there's a 100% chance of going from Amy to Ben. Ben links to Amy, Chris and Dan, so there is a 33% chance of going to any of those pages. We can fill out the other transition probabilities in the same way. So now we can run this Markov chain and see what happens. Imagine you're a surfer on this web. You start on a random page, say Amy, and you keep running the machine and keep track of the percentage of time you spend on each page. Over time, the ratio settles and the scores give us some measure of the relative importance of these pages. You spend the most time on Ben, so Ben is ranked first, followed by Amy, then Dan, and lastly, Chris. It might seem like there's an easy way to beat the system, just make 100 pages all linking to your website. Now you get 100 full votes and you'll always rank on top, but that is not the case. While during their first few steps, they might make your page seem important, none of the other websites link to them. So over many steps, their contributions don't matter. You might have many links, but they're not quality links, so they don't affect the algorithm. But there is still one problem though. Not all pages are connected. In networks like this one, a random server can get stuck in a loop, never reaching the rest of the web. So to fix this, we can set a rule that 85% of the time, our random surfer just follows a link like normal. But then for about 15% of time, they just jump to a page at random. This damping factor makes sure that we explore all possible parts of the Web without ever getting stuck. By using Markov chains, Page and Brin had built a better search engine, and they called it PageRank. Because it's talking about how pages react, web pages react with each other and also because the founder's name is Larry Page, so he snuck that in. With PageRank, they got much better search results, often getting you to the site you were looking for in one go. Although, to some, this sounded like a terrible idea. Others said, oh, well, you're telling me you get a search that will get the right result on the first answer? Well, I don't want that because if it takes them three or four chances, searches to get the right answer, then I have three or chances to show ads. And if you give them the answer right away, I'm just going to lose them. So I don't t see why a better search is better. But Page and Brin disagreed. They were convinced that if their product was far superior, then people would flock to it. I would say it actually is a democracy that works. If all pages were equal, anybody can manufacture as many pages as they want. I can set up a billion pages on my server tomorrow. We shouldn't treat them all as equal. Just looking at the data out of curiosity, we found that we had technology to do a better job of search, and we realized how impactful having great search can be. And so in 1998, they launched their new search engine to take on Yahoo. Initially, they called it BackRub after the backlinks it analyzed. But then they realized that maybe that's not the most attractive name. Now, their ambitions were big to essentially index all the pages on the internet and they needed a name equally as big. So they thought of the largest number they could think of, 10 to the power 100, a Googol. But then when trying to register their domain, they accidentally misspelled it. And so, Google was born. Over the next four years, Google overthrew Yahoo to become the most used search engine. Everyone who knows the internet almost certainly knows Google. Googling is like oxygen to teenagers. And today, Alphabet, which is Google's parent company, is worth around $2 trillion. When Google makes even the slightest change in its algorithms, it can have huge effects. Google. Google. Google. Google. They're on fire, and the reason why they're on fire is because they're focused. And they're more focused than Yahoo who does search. They're more focus than Microsoft who does search with Bing. Yahoo has lots of traffic. They always have. They have some really great properties. But I don't think Yahoo is the go-to place. And at the heart of this trillion-dollar algorithm is a Markov chain, which only looks at the current state to predict what's going to happen next. No text But in the 1940s, Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, started asking a different question. He went back to Markov's original idea of predicting text, but instead of just using vowels and consonants, he focused on individual letters. And he wondered, what if instead of looking at only the last letter as a predictor, I look at the last two? Well, with that, he got text that looked like this. Now, it doesn't make much sense, but there are some recognizable words, like \"whey\" \"of\" and \"the\". But Shannon was convinced he could do better. So next, instead of look at letters, he wondered what if I use entire words as predictors? That gave him sentences like this... \"...The head and in frontal attack on an English writer that the character of this point is therefore another method for the letters that the time of who ever told the problem for an unexpected.\" Now, clearly this doesn't make any sense, but Shannon did notice that sequences of four words or so generally did make sense. For instance, attack on a English writer kind of makes sense. So, Shannon learned that you can make better and better predictions about what the next word is going to be by taking into account more and more of the previous words. It's kind of like what Gmail does when it predicts what you're going to type next. And this is no coincidence. The algorithms that make these predictions are based on Markov chains. They're not necessarily using letters, you know, they use what they call tokens, some of which are letters, some of which are words, marks of punctuation, whatever. So it's a bigger set than just the alphabet. The game is simply we have this string of tokens that, you know, might be, 30 long. And we're asking, what are the odds that the next token is this or this or this. But today's large language models don't treat all those tokens equally because unlike simple Markov chains they also use something called attention No text which tells the model what to pay attention to. So in the phrase 'the structure of the cell' the model can use previous contexts like blood and mitochondria to know the cell most likely refers to biology rather than a prison cell and it uses that to tune its prediction. But as large language models become more widespread. But one concern is that the text they produce ends up on the internet, and that becomes training data for future models. When you start doing that, the game is very soon over. You come, in this case, to a very dull, stable state. It just says the same thing over and over and over again, forever. The language models are vulnerable. To this process. And any system like this, where we have a feedback loop, will become hard to model using Markov chains. Take global warming, for instance. As we increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the air, the average temperature of the Earth increases. But as the temperature increases, the atmosphere can hold more water vapor, which is an incredibly powerful greenhouse gas. And with more water vapor, the temperature increase further, allowing for even more water vapor. So you get this positive feedback loop which makes it hard to predict what's going to happen next. So there are some systems where Markov chains don't work, but for many other dependent systems, they offer a way of doing probability. But what's fascinating is that all these systems have extremely long histories. I mean, you could trace back all the letters in a text, trace back all the interactions of what a neutron did, or trace back the weather for weeks. But the beautiful thing Markov and others found is that for many of these systems, you can ignore almost all of that. You can just look at the current state and forget about the rest. That makes these systems memoryless and it's this memoryless property that makes Markov chains so powerful because it's what allows you to take these extremely complex systems and simplify them a lot to still make meaningful predictions. As one paper put it, problem-solving is often a matter of cooking up an appropriate Markov chain. It's kind of ridiculous to me that this basic fact of mathematics would come out of a fight like that, which, you know, really had nothing to do with it. But all the evidence suggests that it really was this determination to show up Nekrasov that led Markov to do the work. No text But there's one question we still haven't answered. When playing Solitaire, how did Ulam know his cards were perfectly shuffled? I mean, how many shuffles does it take to get a completely random arrangement of cards? If you have a deck of cards, you need to shuffle it, right? OK. How often, if you're shuffling, like, you know, you split it in half and then you do the... How often do you have to shuffle it to make it completely random? Two. Two? I'm going with 26. Four times. Four times? I don't know. 52 times. OK, OK. It's not a bad guess. Seven? It is seven. Really? - Yeah! Yeah, so you can think of card shuffling as a Markov chain where each deck arrangement is a state and then each shuffle is a step and so for a deck of 52 cards if you riffle shuffle it seven times then every arrangement of the deck is about equally likely so it's basically random. But I can't shuffle like that so for me what I do is I do it like this. How many times do you think you have to shuffle like this to get it random? What do you think? And perhaps more importantly, how would you go about working it out? Well, that's where today's sponsor Brilliant comes in. Brilliant is a learning app that gets you hands-on with problems just like this.

In 1825, there was a renowned painter who lived in New Haven, Connecticut, with his wife and two kids. His big break came oneday when he was invited to paint a portrait ofthe Marquis de Lafayette, a hero of the American Revolution. Even though his wife was expecting their third child any day, the opportunity was too good to pass up, and he hastily set off for Washington DC where Lafayette was waiting. There the painter wrote to his wife describing hisfirst meeting with Lafayette, signing off with the words, \"Will write again soon. Love to all the children. In the greatest haste, but with the same ardentaffection as ever, thy loving husband.\" After a few days with no reply, a courier delivered a letter which said his wife wasill after childbirth. Worried, the painter rushed home. He traveled by horse andwagon, day and night, managing to arrive back inNew Haven in several days. (melancholic music) But it was far too late. His wife had died. Not only that, he had missed the funeral. Her body was already buried in the ground. The painter's name wasSamuel Finley Breese Morse. (inquisitive music) From that day forward, Morseset out to find a faster way to communicate over long distances. He got a job at New York University where he attended lectures on electricity, a rapidly developing field at the time. In 1836, along with JosephHenry and Alfred Vail, he devised a machine that could send electricalpulses along a wire. This was not the first electric telegraph, but it was the simplest. In the UK, another team hadset up a series of circuits to move five magnetic needles to point at letters and numbers. Morse's system requiredonly a single circuit, but the simplicity of the apparatus demanded a cleverer methodof encoding information. On the circuit, you couldsend short or long pulses. Morse turned these into dots and dashes. The most common letters could be sent with a single key press, a dot for an E and a dash for a T. The other letters werearranged by frequency and assigned increasingly complex codes. These symbols were meant to be printed at the receiver on a paper strip, but operators soon realized they could recognize theletters just by the sound. (Morse code beeping) This sped up the rate at which information couldbe sent and received, so Morse code became aninternational standard for rapid messaging. (Morse code rapidly beeping) Widely used in the military, maritime communications, and aviation, the universally recognizeddistress call, SOS, what does it stand for? Nothing, it just happensto be easy to send and recognize in Morse code. Morse code revolutionized communication, but in the next century, it would transform atotally different industry. (mellow jazz music) In the late 1940s, Bernard Silver was an engineering student at Drexel University in Pennsylvania. One day, he overheard the president of a local supermarket chainasking the engineering dean to find a way to speedup the checkout process. At that time, cashiershad to type in each item and its price by hand. A process so tedious and repetitive that many cashiers had developedcarpal tunnel syndrome. Silver told his friendNorman Joseph Woodland about the problem, and together, they began experimenting. After several false starts,Woodland moved down to Florida. And one day on the beach, he drew some dots and dashesof Morse code in the sand, something he was veryfamiliar with as a Boy Scout. He recalls, \"I just extendedthe dots and dashes downwards and made narrow lines andwide lines out of them,\" and thus the first barcode was created. From this humble beginning, evolved the universalproduct code or UPC barcode, capable of storing a simplestring of 12 numbers. It's read by scanning a laser across it and checking how much light is reflected to read the black and white lines, essentially as dots and dashes. A pair of vertical lines are placed at the beginning, middle, and end to ensure the scannerreads the code properly. The code is divided intoleft and right halves. Numbers at either side have their black and white lines flipped so that the scanner cantell left and right apart, even while reading upside down. When viewed upright, the numbers typically specifythe manufacturer on the left and the product on the right. Manufacturers actuallypay large sums of money to reserve a given amountof numbers to themselves so that they can exclusivelyregister their products. (scanner beeps) In this way, the 12 digitsof a barcode uniquely specify every single groceryitem you've ever bought. This jar of Jif peanut butter is identified by the same12 digits no matter where in the world it's found. And all forms of peanutbutter, smooth, crunchy, stir, no-stir, sugar-free, low-sodium across all brands gettheir own unique barcode. Will we ever run out of barcodes? Well, 12 digits could combineto provide 10 to the 12, that is a trillion differentpossible sequences. That should be more than enough, even if companies keep makingstuff like Sour Patch Oreos and Flaming Hot Mountain Dew. But there is a catch. The last digit is notindependent of the others. The barcode creators were awarethat it could get scratched, stained, or tampered with, sothey reserved the last digit to verify that the barcode is complete. Take any barcode and sum the digits atodd-numbered positions, multiply this result by three, add the digit sum at even-numberedpositions to the result, and take the remainder whenthis number is divided by 10. If this remainder is zero,then the check digit is zero. Otherwise, the check digitis 10 minus this remainder. (bright electronic music) If a scanner is unable to readany one digit of the barcode, it can use the final digit to back-calculate what itmust be using this algorithm. But if two digits are damaged,well, then we're out of luck. In that case, we have to type in the numbersprinted below the barcode. So without that last digit, the number of uniquepossibilities is 10 to the 11 or 100 billion options. To date, 1.24 billionbarcodes have been registered, a number that is rising every day, so they won't last us forever. (scanner beeping) But that's not why people began to look for alternatives to barcodes. It was really the amount of information a singlebarcode could store. 12 digits by themselves couldonly identify one product. But what if someone wantedto know more information, like where that product came from? (brooding music) In 1986, cattle in theUK began showing symptoms of a curious brain disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease for short. It is spread when cattle ate feed containingprions, misfolded proteins, and if people ate beef containing tissue from the brain or spinalcord of infected cattle, they could contract arelated brain illness that literally turnsyour brain into a sponge. Now, as no test could detectmad cow disease in living cows, millions of cattle were called. Health officials soughta method to track sources in imports of beef. But with all the informationthis would require for any one piece of beef,barcodes were insufficient. American inventor David Allaistried to solve the problem by stacking many barcodeson top of each other. The result, Code 49,looked like a bookshelf. This is actually thepredecessor of PDF417, a code often used onairline boarding passes. But Code 49 didn't solvethe data quantity problem. At best, it multiplied theinformation a barcode could carry by a handful. A more efficient way was to extend barcodesinto two dimensions, creating a data matrix. NASA tried this in 1994 with Vericode, used to track and identifyspace shuttle parts. This code was read by early digital camerasrather than lasers and was initially proprietary. Around the same time, Masahiro Hara, an engineer at a Japanese autoparts manufacturer, DENSO, was getting frustrated athaving to scan multiple barcodes for filling in the samebox of car components. (Masahiro speaking Japanese) Hara set out to developan alternative on his own. He took inspirationfrom an unusual source. (Masahiro speaking Japanese) To understand how informationis stored in a QR code, I am going to build one myself in the way Masahiro Harafirst conceptualized it, with a Go board. I have the usual black and white stones. White represents zero.Black represents one. And we're going to encode the link to our YouTube channel on this board. So the first step is to convert www.youtube.com/veritasium into ones and zeros, and we'lldo that using byte encoding. By encoding uses ASCII, which itself has roots in Morse code. Every character is assigneda number from 1 to 256. Then we convert the ASCIIdecimal into its binary form. Since 256 is 2 to the power of 8, we can use the eightbinary bit combinations to represent all ASCII characters. These eight bits make upone byte of information. (upbeat techno music) The letter W is assignedthe ASCII decimal 119 or 01110111. Doing the same for all characters in www.youtube.com/veritasium, this is what the stringlooks like in binary. This is 26 characters long, so it takes up 26 bytes of information. Now, our board is 25 by 25. This is known as a version 2 QR code, but there are many different sizes, all readable by your phone. Hara's version 1 QR code was 21 by 21, and the largest versiontoday is 177 by 177. That is large enough to holdthree kilobytes of information. Just 26 of these would've been enough to store all the informationApollo 11's computer needed to send humans to the moon. (bright music) One programmer even codedup a computer game, Snake, into a version 40 QR code. (bright music) The region around a QR code must be empty and of uniform color. This is the quiet zone. A distinguishing feature of QR codes is the three squarepatterns in the corners. These position squares allow the reader to identify the orientation of the code. Now, almost all QR codesalso have a fourth square in the last corner, but it's smaller and,hence, trickier to spot. This is the alignment pattern. It's used to rescale the QR code when it's read from varying distances or from crazy oblique angles. The relative size and distanceof the alignment square with respect to the positionsquares allows the software to rescale it into a proper square. Next to the position squaresare plain white strips that isolate them fromthe rest of the code. And these are timing strips, zebra pedestrian crossings which connect the top left position square with the other two. Every QR code has thesealternating strips. You should look out for them. QR codes of all sizesvisibly look the same, so this tells your phonewhich version it is and, therefore, how much data to expect. If there are five alternatingsquares, it's version one. If there are nine, it'sversion two, and so on. And next to those are format strips that contain rules forhow to scan the code. I'm placing red stones in thespace they occupy for now. There is another featureevery QR code has. This one pixel adjacent to thebottom right position square, it is always dark. I asked Hara-san if it hadany special significance, but he said no. (Masahiro speaking Japanese) All of this remainingspace is for data storage. Data inside a QR code always starts at the bottom right corner. Here, the first foursquares carry four bits that specify the data format: 0001 if it's just numbers; 0010 if it's alphanumeric, socapital letters and numbers; 0100 if it's information stored in bytes; and 1000 for Japanese kanji. The following eight bits are used to indicatethe number of characters in our message. So since we have 26 characters, that should be 00011010. Next, we start arranging our bytes for youtube.com/veritasium starting in eight-bit, two-column cells;. They follow a zigzag pattern that snakes its way to the top left. Within each cell that represents a byte, the most significant bit, corresponding to two to theseven, is at the bottom right. And the least significant,or two to the zero, is at the opposite end. 01110111 for W will hence be filled like this. And we'll follow along with the rest. Once we fill in the bytes for www.you, we encounter the alignmentpattern after four bits. To put in the next T, we simplybypass it and do the same for any of the otherfixed regions of the code. Thus, we keep filling in our data in the same zigzag pattern. After we complete www.youtube.c, the cells start looking lessregular and more Tetris-like. But the way we put the stones byte after byte remains the same. (hopeful music) And there go the last eightbits for the last letter M. But wait a minute, we've only covered abouthalf of our QR code. Well, that's because thiswhole remaining space is reserved for redundancy. These extra bytes oferror-correction code allow us to reconstruct informationif the QR code is damaged. (menu whooshing) For a fully intact QR code, error correction makessomething else possible, putting a company logo at the center, just like the sponsorof this video, Saily. Now, I travel a lot. Recently, I was in Germany. Right now, I'm in Australia, and soon, I'm going to the UK. But wherever you are, youneed to have a working phone. Either you pay your homecarrier's hefty roaming fees, or you have to find a placeto buy a local SIM card, put it in the phone, and hope it works. This video's sponsor Saily makes it easy to set up a cell plan and datain more than 150 countries. You can pick how much data you want and how long you want it for. And it is so much cheaper than roaming. I'm actually going to the UK really soon, and here's how quickly I canset up an e-SIM with Saily. All I have to do is click on the country, select a plan, and activate the e-SIM. Then when I land, I'llautomatically connect to a local network with no hidden charges. That's it. There's no needto hunt for public wifi. And you don't have to stand in line at the airport to get a physical SIM. With Saily, you set it up once, and you'll always be connected. And if you find out that your phone isn't compatible with e-SIMs,you will get a full refund. So to check out Saily for free,go to Saily.com/veritasium or click the link in the description. Use the code VERITASIUM to get an exclusive 15%off your first purchase. That's Saily.com/veritasium, or you can scan this handyQR code to get 15% off. So I wanna thank Saily for sponsoring this part of the video, and now back to building our own QR code. (playful music) QR codes offer four levelsof error correction: low, which can still be readwith 7% of the code missing; medium, which can handle 14%; quartile, 25%; and high, up to 30%. This means a QR code couldstill be read properly, even with nearly 1/3 of it missing. Higher levels require morespace for error correction. So knowing how much of the code is error correction is vital. This information is protected in two ways. First, the level of error correction is indicated in the format strip, which is presentidentically in two places. The simplest way to avoid errors is to duplicate the information. Here we'll choose the Mlevel by placing one blue and one yellow stone here at the top left. So what if this part gets damaged? We have a copy in the second format strip starting at the bottom left. The format strip contains three more bits of important informationthat we'll get to later. So for now, I'm just gonnaput down three blue stones in both copies. But what about all therest of the format strip? Well, this is the secondlayer of protection. These other 10 bits are all just designed to correct mistakes inthe first five bits. So how does this work? Let's say I only wantedto communicate two levels of error correction to you, low or high. If one of the bits flips in transmission to 01 or 10, it's easy to knowthat an error has occurred, but no way to know whichthe original message was. An easy way to fix thisis to add another bit. So 000 for low, 111 for high. Now, these are at opposite ends of a cube, and hence, they are further apart. If you then receive 011, it's more likely that theintended message was 111, so it's easy to correct. In this scheme, theonly allowed code words are 000 and 111. The rest act as disallowed buffers to indicate errors in transmission. The allowed code words shouldbe as far apart as possible. Here, they are three vertices apart. This is known as the Hamming distance, after Richard Hamming who pioneered the fieldof error correction. For a Hamming distance of N, you can correct up to N - 1 over 2 errors in a binary string, so one bit flip in the previous example. So back to the five bitsof our format string. If I only wanted to communicateall zeros or all ones, I could place them at opposite corners of a five-dimensional hypercube. However, our string includesall 2 to the 5, or 32, combinations of ones andzeros as valid code words. So to provide buffers like before, we can extend the 5-bitstring into a 15-bit string. And now the 32 valid code words are each separated by seven vertices, or a Hamming distance of seven, which means we can correctup to three bit flip errors. The easiest way to do thisis using a lookup table. The table takes a slightly misread vertex and finds the closest valid vertex, likely the intended code word. But for our main QR code data, we need a far more efficient scheme, one that doesn't require lookup tables or doubling or tripling our data size. (bright music) Let's say I wanna send you a message that is the four numbers 1, -2, 3 and 5. If I just send these numbers, one of them could getcorrupted in transmission, and you wouldn't knowthat an error had occurred or which digit was wrong. So before I send the message,we come up with a plan. First, instead of sending youfour numbers, I will send six. The first four are my actual message, and the last two, A and B, will help you check ifthere were any errors. Now, I want you to treat these six numbers as the coefficients of adegree-five polynomial, and I will pick the values of A and B so that this polynomialcould also be written in the form of a degree-threepolynomial, call it q of x, times x - 1, x - 2. Now, we could set these last two terms to be x minus any number, but for simplicity, let'ssay we pick one and two. That way, when you receive my polynomial, you know that if youplug in x = 1 or x = 2, you should get zero for both because that's how Iconstructed the polynomial. And if you don't get zero, you know there has beenan error in transmission. They are called syndromes. Which is an apt term since syndromes are defined as a group of signs that occur together and characterize a particular abnormality. If the message polynomial is not 0 at any of the syndrome values then there is an error in the code. So how do I find the valuesof A and B in our example? Well, I take thepolynomial without A and B and divide it by x - 1, x - 2. I get a degree-three polynomial, which is what I want, butthere is also a remainder of 37x - 30. So I can move this to the left-hand side. For the polynomialto take the form I want, A must be negative 37 and B positive 30. So I send the message 1, -2, 3, 5, 37, and 30. You can plug in x = 1 and x = 2, and if you get zero for both, you know the message was sent correctly. But what if there was anerror in transmission? Say at position four, thenumber has changed to a six. Well, now if you evaluate at x = 1 and 2, the polynomial is no longer zero. To figure out where the error occurred, one at a time, you set eachcoefficient to be a variable. Then find the value of that variable, setting the polynomialequal to 0 at x = 1. You repeat this for x = 2. And what you find is thatthe two values are different. This indicates that the second coefficient was not the error. You find the same for allthe other coefficients, except when you reach theone where the error occurred. Here, not only are the two values equal, they're also equal to theoriginally transmitted number. That is, five. So this method allows us both to check and correct errors with only amodest increase in data size. (inquisitive music) This is a toy example of a Reed-Solomon error correcting code, developed by mathematicians Irving S. Reed and Gustav Solomon in 1960. (upbeat music) (QR code whooshing) The job of decoding Reed-Solomoncodes in a brute-force way, as we described, canquickly get intensive. In fact, as the Voyager spacecraft floated into the outer solar system, NASA engineers knew theirsignal-to-noise ratio would get incredibly small. But the promise ofReed-Solomon codes was such that they put an experimentalencoder in before launch, wagering that that smarterencoding algorithms would follow in the next decade. And that's exactly what happened. To this day, we can make out Voyager'sever-faintening whispers, thanks to Reed-Solomon codes. These codes also ensure that your old CDs or DVDs can still play your favorite songs and movies despite multiple scratches. And they are the reason why QR codes still work when damaged. In a QR code, the entire data, starting from the datatype, character length byte, our message bytes, and final padding, are laid out in a line and converted back into ASCII decimals. Fitting a high-degreepolynomial using these can easily make the coefficients blow up. Hence, Reed-Solomon encodinguses finite-field arithmetic, Galois fields, to obtainthe error correcting terms. These, converted back into binary, are used to fill outthe rest of the QR code. (bright music) And there we have our complete QR code. But why can't we scan it yet? See how these regions hereappear uniformly white and black? Well, sometimes the encodeddata can insert plain patterns and blank spaces just by chance. These can confound the readers which expect to see a noisy checkerboard. They think maybe it's a big damage patch, or maybe it's not a QR code at all. But there is a way to fix this. Remember the three blue stones I put in for masking in the format string? Well, they specify one of eight ways to reshuffle the appearanceof our QR code pixels to make them seem truly jumbled. Now, this particular mask says, flip the pixels so white becomes black and black becomes white forevery third column of data. But this does not apply to the functional elements of the code. They remain unchanged. (bars whooshing) (QR code beeping) The QR code standard specifies the use of eight masking patterns. In principle, when combinedwith the correct masking bits, all eight forms of the code are readable, which is why some QR code generators will return different looking codes for the same input string. But which one works best? Well, every continuousor bad patch adds points, and each mask gets assigned a score. The mask with the lowestscore at the end wins. It's easiest for any reader to scan. (confetti cannon pops) (audience applauds) For our handmade QR code, I'm going to use the simplest mask. And now we have a working QR code. Try it out. (bright music) And moment of truth. [Speaker] And then we can tape it. Ahh, it worked. You know, going through thisexercise made me realize again why I hate QR codes. They're not meant for people. I made all kinds of mistakes while I was trying to put downthese black and white stones. This was really hard to get this perfect. I guess it didn't have to be perfect, but it had to be close enough, all right. Initially, QR codes hadonly industrial uses. (Masahiro speaking Japanese) But it wasn't long before the value of their data storagecapacity was realized. In 2002, mad cow diseaseresurfaced in the UK. 179 people died fromeating contaminated beef, and people panicked. They wanted to know exactlywhere their meat was coming from and how it was stored beforeit reached the supermarket. This time, the QR codewas available to help. It was one of the first instances where the curious checkerboards started to appear in common use. But why are QR codes so successful? There are plenty of other2D matrix codes out there. Well, one reason is thatDENSO Wave decided not to exercise patent rights on QR codes. (Masahiro speaking Japanese) DENSO instead opted to monetizeand sell QR code scanners. Of course, with the rise of smartphones, most people would sooncarry a QR code scanner in their pocket. But initially, QR code reading apps were third-party and rather niche. But then in 2017, Android and Apple builtQR code readers right into their camera apps, so the use of these codes took off. The COVID-19 pandemic also gaveQR codes a boost worldwide. Suddenly, restaurants andvendors wanted a contactless way to hand out menus and product information. Contactless paymentusing QR codes took off in India and China. Today, India sees over 12 billion QR code-enabledtransactions per month. QR codes also proved handyin storing vaccine records and personal healthinformation in phone wallets. But their enormous spreadhas also created problems. A question about QR code safety: In recent years, somescammers have used QR codes to try to defraud people who read them. Do you have concerns about these uses? (Masahiro speaking Japanese) So as with anything on the internet, you have to pay extra attention to safety. Check where a scannedQR code is taking you before actually clicking on a link. So I wanna know aboutthe future of QR codes. What is next for QR codes? (Masahiro speaking Japanese) Now, if the possibility of running out of UPC barcodes is remote, for QR codes, it is impossible. The number of unique version 1 QR codes using the lowest redundancylevel is 2 to the 152. This is about 10 times the total number of legal chessboard configurations, which is also why a random distribution of pixels filled into a QR code pattern generally cannot beinterpreted as a message. You have scanned countless QR codes, and when you scan your next one, you'll have a better idea of how it works. But have you ever thought aboutwhat QR itself stands for? (Masahiro speaking Japanese) What is your favoriteapplication of the QR code? (Masahiro speaking Japanese) (space tones beeping)"}]}

That's pretty messed up Derek. I slept easier not knowing that. We intercepted his phone calls and stole his two-factor passcodes. Is that your number Linus? Yeah, but I didn't get,mine didn't even ring. We didn't touch his phone. We didn't send him anemail or a text, nothing. We did it all remotelyand the worst part is it could happen to you. I think I'm reallysurprised that, no offense, but like you guys did it. (Derek Laughing) Well, you're not a careercriminal hacker mastermind, necessarily.- No, indeed. But here it is, a normal looking and feeling device with no,you know, obvious problem with it and you just receive my call instead of me receiving it. Just what, like on command? You just, it's an app onyour computer or what? I don't even know. But before we explainhow we did all that, (upbeat music)(crowd clapping) the first startup that Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak made wasn't Apple? No, they were tacklinga different problem. One where their productwas actually illegal. So back in the 1970s, long distance phone callswere really expensive. Adjusted for inflation, a call from New York to Londoncould run you $25 a minute. So these two entrepreneurscreated a little blue box and what it did was ithacked the telephone network. They could trick the telephonecompany into connecting the calls for free among other things. We were young and what we learned was that we could buildsomething ourselves that could controlbillions of dollars worth of infrastructure in the world. I don't think there would'veever been an Apple computer had there not been Blue Box. [Interviewer] Woz saidyou called the Pope. Yeah, we did call the pope. Woz pretended to be Henry Kissinger and we got the number of the Vatican and we called the Pope andthey started waking people up in the hierarchy, you know,I don't know, cardinals and they actually sent someone to wake up the Pope when finallywe just burst out laughing and they realized that weweren't Henry Kissinger. But how were they able to do all of this with one electronic boxmade from Radio Shack parts? (telephone ringing) Until the mid-1920s, mostphones had no way of dialing. When your phone was on the hook, about 48 volts was connected from the exchange to your phone. Then when you lifted the receiver, an internal circuit connected the speaker and microphone drawing power and that caused the voltageto drop to around 10 volts. And at the telephoneexchange this drop turned on a light bulb alerting theoperator who would then pick up and ask who you're calling. [Sarah] Boston. Sarah, get me the Bluebird Diner. And after consulting a directory, they would connect awire between your line and your friends. Manually connecting callswas labor intensive. Operators had to handle hundredsof connections per hour. In 1910, one pundit said, \"Soon the telephone system will need to employ every working age woman in the country as an operator.\" By 1950, there were more than a million of them in the US alone. To reduce costs, companies sought to automate the call connection process and one solution was therotary dial telephone. To use it, you place yourfinger in a number hole, rotate it to the end andthe dial rotates back and on the inside a metaldisc with ridge's turns, each ridge pushes twometal plates into contact completing the circuit to the exchange. The dial sends pulsesto match each number. For the number two, it sends two pulses. For the number threeit sends three pulses. This goes on up to 10pulses for the number zero, which is why zero is atthe far end of the dial instead of beside the one. Those pulses that travel downthe phone line, they determine how your line is connected. So they're known as control signals, but as the length of thetransmission line was increased, so did its capacitance and resistance and this caused the clear inputsignals to become distorted, smoothing out voltage changes. So now the pulses couldn't trigger the switching at the exchange. While this wasn't aproblem for local calls, it made automating longdistance almost impossible. Now all phone lines includinglong distance ones were built to carry sounds in the human voice and hearing range, mainlyfrom 300 to 3,400 Hertz. So why not use this built-in capability to carry control signals. To do this, phone companiesintroduced the touch tone or push button telephone. On a keypad, specific frequencies wereassigned to the horizontal axis and the vertical axis so that each button wasuniquely identifiable by the combination of two tones. (buttons beeping) By sending control signalswithin the voice band, all telephone networks could receive it using their existing systemsindependent of distance. But with this innovationcame an opportunity for jobs and Wozniak to exploit. When you made a long distancecall, it was first routed to a central node. This node communicated with a remote node and they determined if a line was free, by checking whether both sides were sending a 2600 Hertz tone. So Jobs and Woz exploited this. First, they would diala toll free 1-800 number which would get them into a local node and then they would send a2600 hertz tone into the phone. This would trick the remote node into thinking the callhad been disconnected. So the remote node would startplaying the 2600 hertz tone again, but Jobs and Wozwere still on the line. And when they stopped playingthe tone on their side, the remote node assumed anew call was being placed. By sending a key pulse tone followed by the desired phone number and ending with a starttone, they could connect to any long distance number for free as the home node stillbelieved it was connected to a toll-free number. The vulnerabilities in thesignaling system were obvious to mimic the 2600 hertz tone. Some people would even use a toy whistle from a Cap'n Crunch cereal box. It just happened to make that frequency. (whistle blowing) The telephone companies clearly needed to develop a new signaling protocol and their solution was touse a separate digital line for carrying control signals. That way no one could control the network by sending tones down the voice line because it no longer controlledhow the call was connected. This new protocol was calledSignaling System no. 7 or SS7 for short. And it's still broadly in use today, but it may not be assecure as people thought. Hello, my name is Latifa Al Maktoum. I was born-- Princess Latifa of Dubai claimed that herfather Sheikh Mohammed, the ruling emir had heldher in solitary confinement in the dark, beaten andsedated for several years. In late February, 2018, her Finnish martial artsinstructor Tiina helped her escape. They fled to a yacht captain by former French intelligenceofficer, Herv\u00e9 Jaubert. And for eight days theysailed toward India. Latifa was hopeful but it wasn't to last. Late on the night of March4th a dark boat pulled up alongside it was sent by her father. Laser cites pierced the smokeas agents boarded the yacht, abducting Latifa andtaking her back to Dubai. But how did they find her? Well the captain had been the victim of a coordinated SS7 attack, one aiming to pinpoint his location and by extension thewhereabouts of the princess. And I'm going to show you howusing the exact same steps to spy on my friends withtheir permission of course. This is Karsten Nohl andAlexandre De Oliveira. They are cybersecurity specialists who are helping me spy on Linus. We took three steps to spy on him. First you have to infiltrate SS7, second gain trust and third attack. Of course, the main reasonany of this is possible is step one. When SS7 was introduced in 1980, mobile phones barely existed. They were so big thatthey were mainly just used as car phones but things changed quickly and the number of mobilephones in the world exploded. Roaming is one of themain use cases of SS7. Say Derek, you visit me over here. Your phone would try to connectto a network that's foreign and that network wouldthen have to reach out to your home network in Australia asking, is this a valid customer? Are you willing to pay for the charges that they'll incur on my network? And all of that informationis exchanged over SS7. For this to work, telcos need to communicatewith each other. So the way they do that isby making sure they're part of the same club. The way they share membership to this club is by using unique addresses to identify where requests are coming from. SS7 is a global network,just like the internet and like on the internet youneed some addressing scheme. So you need some way of sayingthis is me and this is you. And on the internet we use IP addresses. On SS7 we use what'scalled Global Titles, GTs. [Derek] So to provideglobal roaming coverage, telcos typically establish agreements with two providers ineach country they serve. One primary and one backup. Telcos generally acceptmessages only from Global Titles with which they have agreements. And the whole system isdesigned to be a closed network with few barriers once inside, this is known as thewalled garden approach. So this system seemspretty secure and it was. When SS7 was developed in the '80s, the telecommunicationslandscape was dominated by a few large reputable operators. These operators hadestablished relationships and mutual interest in maintaining the integrity of the network. But 45 years on the landscapehas shifted dramatically. Now there are over 1200 operators and 4,500 networks, many of which need SS7 accessfrom virtual network operators to mass-text services sendingUber Eats notifications. There are so many more playersin the garden that not all of them are trustworthy. Those companies, some of them sell services onto third parties, some of them can be bribed,some of them can be hacked. So there's probably thousands of ways into SS7 atreasonable effort or cost. How much are we talkinglike how much would it cost to buy access to SS7? Buying a single SS7connection isn't that expensive? We're talking a fewthousand dollars per month. The people who do sell access, I mean, why would they do it? People sell SS7 for one reason money. And thanks to global agreements between providers accessing a trusted GT is like gaining access to all the GTs they have partnerships with. We even saw the invoice of a valuable US-basedGT being leased illegally for $13,000 a month. Are you buying access to SS7? I'm paying for access to SS7. Yes. And we do that becausewe do SS7 security tests. So we need to be in a similarposition as real hackers to get near real results. So step one, infiltrate SS7 is complete. Onto step two, gain trust. Hackers today can trymany different things once they've scaled thewall into the garden. But you need more than just SS7 access and a phone number to attack. Even a trusted GT and thephone number of the target isn't enough to uniquely identify them. Now you need something from the SIM card. The real key in a mobile network is a unique 15 digit identifierwhich belongs exclusively to the SIM card on the phone. It's called an internationalmobile subscriber identity or IMSI for short. And it is very important. Basically to be able to collect the IMSI from a subscriber, we would launch some of the messages such as send routing info or send routing info for SM. These messages are normallyused to collect the IMSI. Networks have firewalls in place that will deny some requestsif they look suspicious. Getting an IMSI iscrucial to appear trusted. So let's move on to thecritical step three, attack. Do you wanna just like try the phone? Is there anything you cantry to see if it works? Like call someone.- Sure. [Derek] Or text someone?- Sure. I'll call my wife. She normally pick up. Yeah, she'll probably pick up. [Yvonne] Hello? Hello Yvonne, this isthe voice of your husband. I would like to talk toyou about the payment. Okay, thanks. No, no, it's me. It's me.(laughs) Did she hang up on you?- Yeah, yeah, she did. So we've established the phone works as a completely normal phone. Do you have anyimportant calls coming up? I don't know if I'd say it's important, but I'm on my way toCreator Summit tonight and James from Hacksmith was gonna call me when we're gonna kind of make some plans. (phone rings) I'm getting a call rightnow. Are you getting a call? No. Hello, this is Linus. [James] Hey Linas, it'sJames. How's it going? It's going really well. How are you? [James] Pretty good. Am Igonna see the YouTube summit? Yes, I'm really looking forward to that. And man, do I hate Macs? So I feel like that's your persona man. You can't game on a Mac.Linus, you wanna talk? I would like to talk butI never got the call, so... What number did you dial? [James] 4473.(beep)- Is that your number, Linus? Yeah, but I didn't get,mine didn't even ring. I heard it ring but I heard it through my speakers on my computer. 'Cause I assume it wentto your phone then. That's right.- [Linas] Or did it go to your computer? No. Yeah, it went to everything of mine. So yeah, James, I don't know. You called Linus and it went to me. Thank you for taking partin this weird demonstration. There is absolutelynothing here to indicate that I was supposed to receive a call. Yeah, and I mean the crazy thing is that's like a regularCanadian SIM card in there. So any Canadian SIM card intheory could be vulnerable to such an attack where youknow, someone dials your number and it just doesn't go to you. This is like freaking but ona completely different level. That's exactly it. Now I'm familiar already withthe concept of SIM swapping where you social engineera way to get a SIM that is registered tosomeone else's account. We've actually had accountsstolen that way in the past, but in this case my phone still works. [Yvonne] Hello? Hey, so the demo we'redoing is pretty trippy hun. Basically they had Hacksmith call me, my phone didn't ring at all and instead Derek from Veritasiumpicked up the phone call and was able to talk to himand Hacksmith had no idea that he called me and then-- [Yvonne] Sorry, I'm with Cindy. Oh. Oh, hi Cindy. [Yvonne] Oh, you're not on speaker. Okay, that's fine. Justtell Cindy hi for me. [Yvonne] Okay. Okay, goodbye. [Derek] So how are weable to seize control of Linus number like that? When you put a phonenumber in your address book, you often don't put the country code, but then if you're in a roaming scenario, that phone number would connect to a completely different person in the country you're currently in. So it does make sense to basicallyoverrule people's choices as to whom they're trying to dial because they're not gonnatriple check each time whether the address book entries have country codes in them. This is a powerful function by tricking the network intothinking his phone is roaming, we can rewrite the numberhe is calling to a number that we control. And so what I did at theend was when I received this message, I sent back yournumber that you can see here was your US based number. So even if you were located in Australia, I was still able toforward the call to you on your US number in Australia. That's amazing. You just try a few timesand then it works, right? Yes, it's not alwaysthat simple,(laughs) but this time it was quite difficult. So the most importantquestion I have now then is what did you need to steal from me in order to become me? Like is this somethingyou can social engineer out of my carrier? Is this something that I would need to accidentally leak ascreenshot of my IMEI. At the very simplest, all we would need is your phone number. That's it. You could even dosomething where I could act as a middleman where I wouldreroute the call to me, but also simultaneously I woulddial for you the real number and I would send you through to them and then I can sit on the lineand just record that call. Yikes. But this isn't the only attack. We can do a lot more with SS7. We can also intercept textmessages as part of our suite of attacks. Similar to phone calls, we can trick the networkinto thinking the target is roaming, which reroutestheir messages to our GT. We can then steal one time passwords used in two factor authentication. This type of attack worksuntil the subscriber interacts with their phone network, at which point the phonereconnects to the correct GT. But you need a few seconds only to hack into somebody's account. Of course you need that few second window to receive the one time password. So we actually set up anew Linus YouTube channel. Okay, so theoreticallyhe could get this username and password via a dumpbecause I'm a butthead and I use the same username and password across different accounts or he could install akey logger on my system. He could get it that waywhen I'm typing it in. So then I verify my number. But of course he has my number because that's realisticallynot that hard to find. And theoretically I'm supposed to get a two factorcode right now except... I got it, 820299, I'm in. [Linas] He's in. He hackedthe mainframe. Wild hey. Yep, we could hack your YouTube account. I'm gonna put, I'm gonnastart posting science videos on Linus Tech Tips. Oh, that's okay. I'm sure they'll get like 30million views or whatever. So I'll be fine with it.Thanks for the AdSense (Derek laughing) [Derek] Deal. And you could see the code right there. [Alexandre] Exactly. So you could see that atthe at the bottom. 820299. So basically once theinterception is running, then I would receive any SMS sent. He would never have knownthat he missed those messages or that they were intercepts.- Exact, exact. Wow. Yeah, this seems pretty serious. I mean, SMS two-factor authentication is almost the default, right? Unfortunately, yes,it's not only the default but in some cases it isthe only available option and sometimes that caneven be for accounts that should be treated with the utmost of care like a bank account. [Derek] There's a third method of attack that we weren't able to show Linus. Lucky for him, his network blocked the requests. On many networks, you can use the IMSI numberin the switching center info we harvested in step two to send a command deeper into the network. By targeting the switchingcenter where the device with the IMSI is connected, we can issue a command routinely used for legitimate purposes suchas routing and forwarding calls or providing emergency services based on the device's location. Using this request we cantrack a target's location. It's not as hard as you'd think. SS7 doesn't even rely onGPS to locate someone. In fact, it was invented beforeGPS was even in public use. One way to do this isif a target is in range of multiple cell towers, theirlocation can be narrowed down to where the signals overlap. The more towers in range, themore precise the location. A more accurate methodmeasures the time it takes for signals to reach aphone from three towers. By calculating the distancebased on transmission speed, we can pinpoint an exactlocation on a 2D plane, but SS7 attacks don't useeither of these methods. They try to be subtle. An SS7 location request simplyidentifies the cell tower the target is connected to. In an urban area with many towers, this can place them towithin a hundred meters. You'll definitely know whichcity block somebody is in and if you wanted to, forinstance find out was it at home and or at work, this isa great way to do it. Yeah, it's a little bit scary. In 2016, Karsten and histeam used this method to track US Congressman Ted Lieu. The congressman has been in California, more specifically the LA area. Let's zoom in here a little bit. So that is how we did it.We executed three steps. We infiltrated SS7,gained trust and attacked. We intercepted Linus phonecalls and text messages. I'm not sure he was asexcited about it as I was. This is why we can't have nice things. Up until now, this hasjust been a bit of fun. I've demonstrated theseattacks on a friend of mine, but the threats are real and they can havedevastating consequences. \"They will kill her.\" The captain texted shortlybefore Latifa was abducted. His phone was the target of an SS7 attack that involved all threeof the steps we explored. To start, the attackershad leased multiple GTs in different countries then the following all happenedin a five minute window. First they sent at leastseven separate requests aiming to get the captain's IMSIfrom his US based operator. When that didn't seem towork, they followed up with at least four location requests. So did it work? Well, all of these requestswere blocked by firewalls. That's why we have all the details. But there was a sixth GT we haven't shown. This one nearby in the US, we have no information aboutthe requests on this GT because they likely weren't stopped. We spoke with Crofton Black,the investigative journalist who revealed the SS7exploits in this story and this is what he told us. \"It's a brilliant exampleof SS7 involvement because it illustrates aclassic sophisticated pattern of attack, multiple GTsand multiple countries. It's a textbook example oftelco penetration risks.\" Though, because the Emiratiswere also using other software like Pegasus and otherhardware like spotter planes. We can't say that any singleone of these was the thing that led to her being found. But the evidence is damning and SS7 is used pretty widely. Criminals have used SS7 to intercept SMS two-factorauthentication codes and empty millions ofdollars from bank accounts. For some SS7 is just the first step. The NSO Group, a notorious Israeli cybersurveillance firm acquired an SS7 tracking company in 2014. NSO is the company behindPegasus, a spyware tool that gains complete access to targeted phones withouta user clicking anything embedding itself anderasing traces of entry. Such zero click hacks are costly. They can cost more than$4 million per exploit. Before NSO commits resourcestargeting specific software or vulnerabilities on a phone, first they gather basicdata like device type and software version tomake their lives easier. And as you've seen withSS7, this isn't hard. One expert we spoke totested a foreign network and found 20 to 30 VIPs were constantlyunder surveillance there, including the country'schief of cybersecurity. Accurate data on trackingis difficult to come by, but another expert providedevidence of more than two and a half milliontracking attempts per year. Though they reminded us thatthe people being targeted are generally those ofinterest to state agencies. Now we couldn't find dataon interception attempts, but luckily experts toldus this is far less common. So millions of malicious SS7requests are sent each year, but it used to be even worse. To request location over SS7, you used to be able to send acommand without even knowing the IMSI and the networkwould just provide it to you. No questions asked. The classical example isthe anytime interrogation request, which as the name already suggest is have a creepy command. I don't believe there'sever legitimate purpose for one network to send this command to another network interrogatingabout their customers. [Derek] Karsten Nohl and fellow securityresearcher Tobias Engel exposed these vulnerabilitiespublicly in 2014. The SS7 research thatwas disclosed in 2014 was a wake up call to the industry. Most people had heardrumors that SS7 tracking and spying was possible, but they hadn't reallyseen hard evidence of it and especially how easyit is that ragtag gang of hackers from Berlin with very amateur means can do any type of SS7 hacking that they want. [Derek] After their conference, all of the German telcosimmediately started refusing these requests. Anytime integration isthe first SS7 command, everyone stopped becauseit was abused a lot and never used constructively. But there is over 150 othermessages that need to be stopped as well to make SS7 be completely secure. So if there are somany ways to abuse SS7, why haven't we gotten rid of it? Well, because it's the backbone of 2G and 3G communications. So what if we phase out 2G and 3G? Well, that has caused problems. Since 2018 cars in the EU are equipped with mandatory emergency call buttons that trigger in an accident. They need a SIM card towork and to cut costs, guess what auto manufacturers are using. That's right. 2G and 3G SIM cards using SS7. You have to have that legacy support or when 4G connectivity drops, you have absolutely nothing left. Dude, the number of times thatI'm on 3G, not insignificant. And I'm in a metropolitan area. What's surprising, of course, is that there hasn't been aglobal push yet to replace SS7 with one of the two newerversions of the technology. The latest of which that was introduced with 5G seems pretty secure, but that's now a problem offirst mover disadvantage. So because of the networkeffects you get nothing out of adopting atechnology as the first guy. You wanna be the lastone when everyone else is already connected andyou get the full benefit from also joining the club. [Derek] So even thoughthe 5G signaling protocol can stop the attackscompletely and many networks are using 5G technology on their networks, when routing calls between networks, SS7 is still the de facto standard. You create a tremendousamount of inertia to use a term that's probably more yourchannel than my channel. That makes moving on extremely difficult. So unless there aresome new major events that put this back on the public radar, it could be another 10,15, maybe even 20 years until SS7 networks arefinally switched off. What's crazy is that weexploited these vulnerabilities and I'm just a YouTuber. I did have the help of someexcellent security researchers, but I'm surprised at how easy it all is. Now imagine if I had thebacking of a government. This is a real problem. So what can you do to protectyourself on the personal side as long as you have a SIM card? Unfortunately there's not much you can do about location tracking. If possible, choose alternatives to SMS based two-factor authentication. So messages can't be intercepted. Use an Authenticatorapp or hardware tokens. And if you're worried about phone tapping, use encrypted internetbased calling services like Signal or WhatsApp. We've been told this is mainlyused on people of interest. So should it really matter to you? SS7 is a huge privacy intrusion and there's this millions ofabuse cases every single month. Whether privacy intrusion isa problem for individually, of course as almost aphilosophical question, right? Somebody who grew up morein the Berlin tradition of the Chaos Computer Club like myself, strongly beliefs that privacy and the ability to kindof form your own thoughts without being observed is aprerequisite for democracy. But many other people would argue nothing to hide, nothing to fear. (scrappy music) Our technological worldwill never be perfect. By the time we secure or replace SS7, vulnerabilities willalready have been found in the new system, but luckily there's aneasy way to be ready for whatever the futureholds, build your knowledge and problem solving skillsa little bit every day.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: hermite welding for railroad tracks and explains why modern railroads don't need expansion joints"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Previously on Veritasium, welearned how Hans Goldschmidt discovered that metal oxide-like rust can react with aluminum powder to produce pure liquid metal. Oh! Reactions of this type areknown as thermite reactions. (dramatic music) Whoa! (laughs) Whoa! Yeah! (explosions popping) That is crazy! Wow. (dramatic music continues) Initially, thermite foundlimited applications, repairing heavy machineryin remote locations. It's much more common use, The one where it's widely employed today, took a bit more convincing. There is one sound that everyoneassociates with railroads. (soft banjo music)(train wheels clacking) This is the sound oftrain wheels passing over the join between one rail and the next. In the early days of railroads,steel mills produced rails that were around 12 meters long. Then, out in the field, these were bolted togetherusing fish plates. (soft banjo music fades) That would create these little gaps between the pieces of rail. And cause this kinda like signature sound, This ta-tak, ta-tak, right? And everybody who thinks railroad, this this ta-tak, ta-tak, ta-tak, ta-tak, even though we don't hear that anymore. But we still imagine itbecause it was so signature for the sound to ride on the train (train wheels clacking) The track would flex, causingthe train to rock and roll, and it would also increasethe wear on the wheels and create vibrations in the tracks, so they required frequent maintenance. So you might expect thatafter thermite was invented, railroads would've been excited to weld their railstogether with liquid metal, but that was not the case. (soft whimsical music) They would never havethe idea to weld them. If he'd come to a railroadmanager and told them, \"I'm Dr. Hans Goldschmidt, I have a process by which Ican weld your thumbs together.\" To these railroad managers, that would've sounded more useful than what he actually proposed, which was welding their rail. See, the gaps between railswere considered essential, because railroads areexposed to the elements all year round. So, they shrink whenthey get cold in winter, and expand in the heat of summer. An increase of 40 degrees Celsius would cause a 12 meter length of rail to grow by six millimeters. Without gaps in the rail, people expected kilometers of railway to expand and buckle, leading to the worst possible outcome. Train derailments. So if someone pitched, \"We're just gonna connectall the rails together.\" That would be a terrible idea. That would be a terrible idea. (dramatic music) The longer the rail, the bigger the gap, the bigger the problem. And now somebody says, \"Hey,I can make an infinite rail.\" That just causes an infinite problem. (dramatic music continues) The first ones that wereactually willing to discuss this were the tram rails. Tram rails, they're in cities, they're embedded into the streets. Tram rail is much, much smaller, so the forces are much less. So, the tram rails were the first ones that were interested in, \"How can we kind of get ridof this ta-tak, ta-tak?\" Because it's kind of annoying, you know, in the middle of the street. That was basically the first attempts. And I think in Essen, andthen later on in other cities (mellow guitar music) For this video, I got the opportunity to weld two rails together using thermite. And I'm going to take you through the eight steps in the process. First, I'll show you how I did it... (Derek sighs) Man, this is difficult. And then we'll compare thatwith how the pros do it. All experiments were performed under the supervision of professionals, with proper safety precautions. Okay. We're out here inthe German countryside, and tonight they're goingto be welding this rail. They're gonna do like 150 welds tonight. (mellow guitar music fades) When you're welding rail for real, you wanna do it at the neutraltemperature of the rail. That is, a predefinedtemperature at which the rail should have no stress in it. And is the temperature bywhich that piece of track that you're welding in, is supposed to have zero tension. When it gets colder than this, there's going to be negative tension, and when it gets warmer,there's positive tension. And since we were filmingin Germany in the summer, they weld at night, afterthe rail has cooled off. Initially, when the rails are laid out, they're placed so they'retouching each other. And the first step in welding rail is therefore to create a gap into which we'll pour the liquid thermite steel. So, you have to cut abouttwo and a half centimeters off the end of one rail. This can be done with a circular saw. Let's do this. (circular saw revs)Cutting a rail. Out in the field, they cuttheir gap with a torch. (mellow guitar music) Looks good.(circular saw buzzing) (mellow guitar music continues) Whew! I just need to take a little break. Ugh. That is really exhausting. (circular saw buzzing) The next step is to line up the rail so the weld will makea seamless connection. Both rails have to be angledslightly up toward the gap. This is because when the liquidthermite steel is poured in, it will contract as it cools, which creates an inward pulling force. But that force won'tbe the same everywhere. Since there's more metal at the top, there's more force pullingthe rail together there. So, that's why the railshave to be angled up, so that after the liquid steel contracts, the rails will be perfectly flat. Now you take one of the wrenches, and put it a little bit under the rail. Like there? Or like this? Sideways. Sideways would be a little bit better. Yep.(metal clangs) [Christoph] Yep, that's fine. [Derek] Okay. Same goes for the other side. We will check. There's no gap at the moment. We need 2.42, 3.6 here. Hit it.(hammer clangs) But now this rail is wayhigher than this one, and we want to have both on the same high. Means now we have to hit this batch. We do that so long untilwe have correct height. (hammer clangs)(whimsical music) Okay, stop. Up. (hammer clangs) In addition to the vertical alignment, the rails also have tobe horizontally aligned. [Christoph] If we take a look here, there's a large gap between thestraight edge and the rails. [Derek] There's a gap there. [Christoph] And they need to- [Derek] We need moreof a peak this side. [Christoph] Yeah. Okay.(hammer clangs) And it's a frustrating process, because trying to align them horizontally throws out the verticalalignment and vice versa. I'm lucky I had help, or Iwould've been here for hours. When we were finally done that, we double checked the alignment at the head and foot of the rail, and we made a terrifying discovery. Our rail is twisted. [Derek] Even though bothrails were aligned at the top, One rail was slightly twistedrelative to the other, which you can see by itnot lining up at the foot. [Christoph] We have a maximum tolerance that is allowed here of two millimeters. [Derek] Yep. Here we have more than two millimeters, so we have to untwist the rail. This, of course, throughout the verticaland horizontal alignment, so we had to do that all over again. (hammer clangs) Are we getting closer? [Christoph] A little bit more. (hammer clangs) [Derek] But out in the field, the guys align the railso quickly and easily, It really is an art. (hammers clanging) (objects rattling) Now we can adjust the clamping device. [Derek] This will hold the mold shoes and preheating torch in place. The preheating torch will sit in here. Yeah. [Christoph] And we willkeep the molds in place with that arms here. Okay. [Christoph] The next step,we will align the burner. It's really important toalign the torch properly, so that both sides of therail get heated equally. I mean, I think it looks pretty good, but maybe a little bit that way, so maybe it could go just a touch. [Christoph] There's onemold, and the plug for you. [Derek] Next, we'll put themolds inside the mold shoes, attach them to the clamps... Line 'em up. And align both sides. It's essential to makethe seal water tight, because liquid steelis as liquid as water, but almost eight times more dense. So if it's not sealed properly, the steel would just pour out. It looks pretty good. [Christoph] I hope so. (both laughing) I didn't expect us to getit this good on our first go, after just the trouble aligning the rails. (whimsical music) The alining the rails isone of the hardest parts. Ugh. It's madness. So, this is sand? Like beach sand? No, it has larger amount of clay inside. It holds in place and seals. I will start sealing this side, you can start sealing this side. I start sealing with hand, and I will compact itwith stamping the walls. (whimsical music)(tools clattering) [Derek] And to make surethat none of the liquid metal can spill out, we pack in additional sandall over on the sides, so there's absolutely no gaps. (tense music) Then it's time for one ofthe most crucial steps, to preheat the rail. [Christoph] Put itin, tighten the screw, and the opening the valve. [Derek] We also prepareda demo behind glass, so we can see into the welding process, including preheating. Preheating is essential for a few reasons. First, it gets rid of any moisture and other volatiles in the mold, which would create bubbles when the molten steel is poured in. Second, it makes bothrail ends really hot, which is crucial becausethe rate of heat transferred depends on the difference in temperature between two materials. If we poured liquid steel in between two room temperature rails, well, the liquid steel would cool rapidly, and that's a problem. (tense music) We will heat up two pieces of rail... (torch hisses) And we will cool down onereally fast in water... (torch hisses) And the other one we willcool down in sand, so, slowly. (tense music continues) Just to show how the hardness increase depending on the cool-down time. And now you try to break it. That's hard to bend, actually. (Derek grunts) (whimsical music)(tool clangs) (hammer thuds) Yeah, it's hard to bend. That's the one that was in the water. Yeah. And we cooled it down really fast. (whimsical music continues) (metal clangs) And that is how to break it. And now you see how the structureof the steel has changed. It breaks very easily. [Derek] That's becausewhen steel cools rapidly, carbon atoms get trapped in the lattice, creating this needle-like microstructure. And that forms a kind ofsteel known as martensite. Martensite is reallyhard, but also brittle, since the lattice canno longer absorb energy without fracturing. (whimsical music fades) (metal clangs) (tense music) Now we can take a look on the clock. Yep. We have 1.5 minutes untilwe have to remove it again. Okay. The next step is to ignite the thermite. And it's important to do this right after we turn off the preheating. Five, four, three... Two, one. So, I put the plug in the mold, and then the thermite bucket on top, and then I ignited it... (flame hisses) Oh my goodness, no! (tense music) In making these videos, the team and I oftentravel around the world talking to scientists andfilming at research facilities. I mean, guess where I am right now? We filmed part one ofthis video in Germany. Casper's been in the Netherlandslearning about strongbase, and Peter has just comeback from trying and failing to break glass in New York. It is a great job perk, but there is one really annoying problem, which is that it's hard to stay connected with the rest of the teamwhile we're out on location. We either have to payridiculous roaming charges, or find a local sim card, or just search around for public wifi. And as you can imagine, this isn't something wereally wanna be dealing with while we're making a video. Which is why we use thisvideo sponsor, Saily. Saily makes it incrediblyeasy and affordable to stay connected while you're abroad. You download it once, and then you can use itin over 180 countries. Just choose how much data you want, how long you want it for, and it's super quick to set up. All you have to do is selectthe country and the plan, then activate the eSIM, and you're done. It's also much cheaper than roaming.

(tense music) Oh my goodness! (Derek laughs)(intense music) Woo! Wow! (intense music continues) So, the thermite reactionis taking place inside. We're forming molten steel andalso molten aluminum oxide. (intense music continues) All these demos areincredibly difficult to shoot, because they're gonna be many, many orders of magnitude brighterthan the normal scene. So, just getting exposureis a huge challenge. Something this reminds me ofis that the power radiated by something thermally is proportional to temperatureto the power of four. So, slight increases in temperature result in huge increases in power. (dark tense music)(torch hisses) (dark tense music continues) In the previous video, we showed what happened inthe crucible through glass. So, you can see the liquid steel and the liquid aluminum oxideforming and separating out, and then the liquid steeldropping out the bottom. Well, here we get to see that liquid steel falling into the mold. (dark tense music continues) So, the liquid steel comes in first, and it goes all the way to the bottom. Next, the slag starts to come out. But since aluminum oxide hasa lower density than steel, it's just gonna float on top, and go out the sides into the slag pans. So, that makes sure thatwe don't get any slag mixed in with the liquid steel. That is so awesome. [Derek] Yeah. [Axel] That is just spectacular. Whoa! [Derek] Ah, that is brilliant. (tense music) And now we wait. We need the steel to cool longenough so that it's solid, but not too long so thatthe excess steel and slag is difficult to remove. You have to get the time right. What does he think? You guys tell me ifit's not liquid anymore. I believe you. Oh, two minutes passed. So, let's wait 30 seconds more. [Derek] After that time has elapsed, then it's time to essentiallyclean up this weld. So, we can remove the slagpans and the mold shoes. (objects clanging) And we break off the top of this mold. (soft dramatic music) These are really single use molds. They get destroyed in this process. (machinery humming) [Christoph] And nowwe put it on the side. Put this... By the slag pens? [Christoph] That's fine. Then we used a weld shear that can create up to 20 tons of force to shear off the excess steelfrom the top of the weld. (weld shear buzzes) (soft dramatic music fades) (tense music) And after that's done, we hammered off theremaining excess parts. (hammer bangs) That's fun, actually. I like that step. The next step is to grind down the weld, so it's exactly thesame level as the rail. Obviously, you don't want any bumps when the train is going over it, but also you don't want any indents, so this grinding step is really important. So, we put on the grinding machine, and grind until maximum onemillimeter of materials left. And we try to only grindon top of the weld. Yeah. (grinder whirring) (intense music) (grinders buzzing) It's normally conducted in two phases. First there's a rough grind, and then a finer grind is applied later. And we only grinded the top surface. Yep. We did not grind the running flank. Yep. [Christoph] Then you have to lift down the grinding device, and hold everything so it's even heavier than the part we've done before. That's rough grinding right there. I'm sweating' It's like a serious workout. (Derek chuckles) The guys in the fieldwere obviously much better at grinding down the rail than I was. So, they would move on, leaving a still glowing hotsection of the rail behind them. (mellow music fades) There probably will be millions of people watching this video. What is the likelihoodthat they have ridden over one of your thermite welds? They will. Hundred percent. Hundred percent. Anywhere in the world? Anywhere in the world. Of course, there is countries- North Korea. Where are not the marketleader or something, but... Finally they will ride above our welds. (soft tense music) [Axel] We'll just cut it out, and then take it overto the methodology lab. (Derek grunts) That is heavy. Oh! That's my weld. My first thermite weld. Man, that is hot. (Derek exhales) This is what you have done yesterday. We can now put it in the acid. What does the acid do to the surface? The acid attacks the steel. But because the orientationof the crystals, inside the steel is not the same, the acid attacks it not inthe same way everywhere. And because this is different, you can see different structures. You can see some finestructures in the rail, in the heat-affected zone, and in, let's say, the fusion zone. Mhm. Can I touch it? Yeah. [Derek] Yeah, you can't really feel it. [Christopher] It's a microscopic basis. Yeah.- You cannot feel it. It's interesting, youcan see it, but not- Yeah. [Derek] And it's a very fine line. [Christoph] I mean, you cansee the different structures of the crystals even. [Derek] In the weld, youcan see three different zones. The normal rail is on eitherside with a horizontal grain, due to how it was rolledin the steel mill. In the middle is the thermite steel. You can still see a bitof horizontal grain, but here it doesn't comefrom the steel being rolled, since this just solidified from liquid. Instead, it formed fromthe solidification front, moving from the sides to the center. And when the crystalsfrom both sides meet, it creates tiny microscopic pores, resulting in this darkerline in the center. Now, the boundary of thethermite steel isn't sharp. And that's because as theliquid steel pours in, it actually melts some of the rail. This helps it form a strong bond. A good weld would be enough with just one atom layer fused. But we are using the processon a construction site. And on the construction site, not everything is so goodhandled like in a laboratory. The gap is not a hundredpercent, always the same. So, we need something robust, which functions on construction sites. [Derek] In Germany,regulations require melting of about three millimeters off each rail. The final zone is inbetween the normal rail and the thermite steel. This steel didn't melt,but it received enough heat that the crystal structure changed, resulting in a smaller grain structure. This is known as the Heat Affected Zone. If you measure thehardness across the weld, this zone is actually the weakest, both in terms of hardness and yield. The amount of force it takes to permanently deform the steel. So if a weld breaks,it's almost always here. [Christoph] That's a line you could see on that macro etching. Thermite.- [Derek] Yep. That's a fusion line. And here we have nowrail seal heat affected. So, the structure ischanged by heating up, and then re-crystallization of the steel. [Derek] So then I guess the question is, how strong is rail that's been welded? Well, at Goldschmidt, theyactually take sections of rail that they have welded, and they test them until failure. Every 200, basically,we create one test weld, and we analyze it in terms of chemistry, we analyze it in terms of hardness, and we analyze the bending. And this is the bending press. They put this in, right? And then the force comesfrom top and then goes down, and it breaks it. And we measure the speedand also the force. I'd say, it looks like it's flexing a bit. So we're loading up thatweld, bending it until it snaps. See that curve go. We wanna see how muchforce it takes to snap, and exactly where that break occurs. 140 tons. It's getting really deflected now. Yes.- Yeah. 150 tons. (metal clangs) Ooh! That was cool. I was just expecting a little crack, like that was catastrophic failure. (person laughs)Just over 150 tons. So, we think the crack propagatedfrom the bottom upwards? 'Cause it's being pushed down like that. So, this is under a lot of tension. [Axel] Yes. So, it breaks under tensiondown here, rips up this way. And so it doesn't breakin the middle of the weld. You're saying this zone beside it, which is a previous rail material that got heated up in the weld. Yeah.- Is actually weaker. Yes. [Derek] Whoosh. (grinder buzzes) Every year, around 2 million welds are performed using thermite. And around half useGoldschmidt's thermite. Now, each weld creates about two and a half centimeters of rail. So, in total, that's 50kilometers of railroad created every year out of liquid steel. You have a very demanding process, and you have to make sure thatthere's certain properties with respect to bending,with respect to tension, with respect to hardness. (soft music) That's a process that needsto be kind of replicated every, every, every time,a million times a year. So, with all this continuously welded rail around the world, why doesn't it buckle insummer when it heats up? Well, that's because there's another way to change the length of the rail. Okay, imagine a piece of rail. If we use a powerful machineto push on it from both sides, it will shorten slightly. And if on the other handwe pull on the rail, it will lengthen. So, you can use mechanical stress to change the length of the rail. The fractional change inlength is called \"strain\". And if you plot the relationshipbetween stress and strain, you find it has a linear relationship, at least with elastic deformation. As long as the stressesapplied are not too large, the rail will spring backto its original length when the stress is removed. And this is key, becauseas long as we do that, we have two ways to change the length. Thermal and mechanical. And we can use one tocompensate for the other. When the rail thermally wants to expand, we can use mechanicalforces to compress it. This is what the sleepersand the ballast are for. The sleepers pin down the rail, and the ballast locksthe sleepers in place. So as the temperature increases,the rail doesn't lengthen. Instead, the stress in the rail, the compressive stress increases. And the rail just expandsto the top =and sides, which are unconstrained. It's also interesting to notethat railroads typically use as high of a neutraltemperature as they can, because a rail thatshrinks too much in winter and cracks under tensionis less problematic than one that expands too much in summer, and therefore buckles. It's also easier to detect a cracked rail using conductivity measurements than one that has buckled. So, thermal expansion and contraction are counteracted by mechanical stress. That is the reason why we don't need expansion joints in railways. It allows trains to go faster with fewer bumps and vibrations, and much less maintenance. Grady from PracticalEngineering actually made a whole video aboutthis, and it's excellent. I'd recommend it. So far, we've seen thermiteunder normal conditions. Wow! Conditions that are expertly tuned to protect thermite from its environment. Oh, oh, oh! But in the next thermite episode, we'll find out what happenswhen this is not the case. And we'll learn how to work with thermite under these conditions. (explosions booming) So trust me, you don'twant to miss part three. [Cameraman] My hands are shaking. Right? Make sure you'resubscribed to get notified when that video comes out. (electronic beeping)"}]}

But the robots we'll see in the future might not look like that at all. I mean, if humans areinteracting with something on a daily basis, it'sprobably best not to make it sharp, delicate, and heavy. How rude. [Derek] Instead, advancedrobots might be made safer if they're soft, flexible, and all kinds of shapes and sizes. So instead of Sonny from I, Robot. No. [Derek] Something likeBaymax from \"Big Hero 6\" might be closer to what's in our future. Balalala. This is a compilationvideo of five of my videos on the surprisingly differentways robots can look, and why we build them that way. This is my first time trying out a series, and honestly, it's been a busytime for the Veritasium team. We're working on some excitingthings in the background. But in the meantime, we wanted to put thistogether for all of you. And I also caught upwith Dr. Elliot Hawkes, the scientist behind two of these robots, to get an update onhow they're progressing and when we can expectto see them in our lives. Are there more developments happening with the jumping robots? We have a whole notherproject on jumping, and it doesn't even use springs. So I won't give away our our secrets yet. But keep an eye out for that one too, 'cause that's gonna be fun. So you have another jumping robot which has a totally novel design? Yep. And you think it's gonna be better than the one that you had before? Correct. And I just wanna shout out our longtime sponsor, Brilliant. They've supported the channel since 2021, and it's great to getto talk about something that I actually use myself. I've had Brilliant on my phone for years, and it just allows me tolearn something new every day, instead of, say, doom scrolling. You should make valuable use of your time. So I will tell you more aboutBrilliant later in the video. Non-humanoid robots aren't just safer for us to interact with. One of their biggest advantagesover traditional robots is that they don't just do things humans already do, but better. Instead, they're specialized to master entirely new abilities, often ones that no human can tackle. This is a robot that can growto hundreds of times its size, and it can't be stoppedby adhesives or spikes. Although it looks kindof simple and cheap, it has dozens of potential applications, including one day maybe saving your life. These robots can be madeout of almost any material, but they all follow thesame basic principle. Powered by compressed air,they grow from the tip. That's good. [Derek] And this allows the robot to pass through tight spaces,and also over sticky surfaces. Something like a carwill get stuck to it. It gets stuck in the wheels. Now if I do the samething with the vine robot, see the robot is able to extend. [Derek] It can navigate this curvy and twisted passageway effortlessly, which suggests some of the applications it's well suited for. Now, you might think spikeswould be the downfall of an inflatable robot. But even if it's punctured, as long as you havesufficient air pressure, the robot keeps going. And you might be able to hear it. It's actually leaking now. So I'll have to turn up the pressure. This by itself is not yet a robot. But once we add steering,a camera, some sensors, and maybe some intelligence asto where we're directing it, then we could say it's a robot. So this is sort of thebackbone of a robot. This is what allows us tobuild our type of robots. [Derek] So where did theidea for this device come from? I had a vine in myoffice that was on a shelf, and it was kinda out of the sunlight. And over the course of like a year or so, it slowly grew out this tendril, out and around the edge of the shelf and towards the sunlight. I said, that's a pretty coolthing it just did, right? So you start thinking, well, is there a way youcould do that robotically? [Derek] The solution is reallyelegant in its simplicity. Just take some airtight tubingand fold it in on itself. It's kinda like a water wiggly, those toys that are really hard to hold. When you inflate it with compressed air, it starts growing out from the tip. And if you want the tube toalways bend at a certain spot, you could just tape thetubing on the outside to shorten one of the sides. For example, you could tapeit into a helical shape to create a deployable antenna. What about getting them to retract? Yeah, that's a challenging problem. When you're in a constrained environment, all you really have to do ispull on, we call it the tail, so the material that is passing through the core of the body. You pull on it and it basically outgrows, it just goes back inside itself. Now if you're in a big open area like this and you try pulling on that, instead of inverting, so retracting, it tends to kinda coilup and make a ugly shape. [Derek] And the engineershave come up with ways to retract the tube toprevent it from buckling using internal rollers. But the tube doesn't haveto be the same diameter the whole way along. Here there's actuallya much wider section. Think of it like a pillow that's packed into the end of the robot. Yeah, if you couldsit cross-legged on it. Cross-legged on the table? This sounds super sketchy. So it grows underneaththe table just as usual, and then, as the pillowpart starts inflating. Is this not good, or is this okay? It can actually lift me up. So my balance is not great, as we can see. [Elliot] Try standing on it. Stand on it?- Yeah. What's amazing is thatthis doesn't require much pressure above atmospheric. Just a tenth of an atmosphereapplied over a large area, like a square meter, canlift something as heavy as a thousand kilograms, allthe while remaining soft. Whoa. Woo. That was great. That's the paradoxicalthing about pressure. You can get a large overallforce with low pressure as long as the area is large enough. What sort of area isthat, that pillow there? It's 600 square inches. So with one PSI, 600 pounds. Yeah, that's just crazy.- Two PSI, 1,200 pounds. [Derek] And the wholetime, it feels really soft. Yeah, 'cause there'sa couple PSI, right? [Derek] It's importantthat the device is still soft so it doesn't hurt anyone. So you can design these things to have cross-section thatchanges along its length. So it could be a very small body that could grow into, forexample, a collapsed building and potentially lift a large object off someone who's trapped, or maybe in a car crashor something like that. It can apply huge forces with very soft andlightweight, cheap materials. [Derek] These robotscan also be deployed in search and rescue operations by attaching sensors likea camera onto the front. These robots are actuallyreally hard to stop. So you can take them,grow them into a clutter, potentially a collapsedbuilding or something like that, and they will continue to go somewhere. An alternative is, they're so cheap. I mean, they're basically free. You could grow a hundredof 'em, let's say, into a collapsed buildingwith some sensing on them, and maybe only one of them finds somebody. But I mean, that's ahuge success if it does. [Derek] But how do you keep a camera connected to the front of the robot when it grows out from the tip? Well, one way is to use an end cap, which allows that camerajust to stay on the front, pushed from behind by the robot. But there are othermechanisms of attachment. The tiny wireless camera ismounted on an external frame, but this frame interlockswith an internal frame, which is actually insidethe pressurized part of the robot body. It's similar to how aroller coaster's wheels go around the track. So this prevents thecamera from falling off as the robot grows. What's really interestingis how the vine robot can be actively steered. They attach artificialmuscles to the robot. So the way this muscle worksis that if you inflate it, it expands sideways, which leads to it contracting in length. We don't actually use these much anymore because although it's soft,it's still somewhat stiff. So what we use instead are simply tubes of thisripstop nylon fabric, with the braid oriented at 45 degrees. So in this sense, we just have one singlelayer of airtight fabric. This is the main robot body here. Then we have three pneumaticmuscles connected to it. Now, these three muscles are each connected totheir own air supply, connected to regulators over here. As the robot extends from the tip, we can steer it by shorteningand lengthening the sides. So just the way your hand works is if I shorten this tendon in my arm, my hand will move this way. Or if I shorten the one on this side, it'll move the other way. So our vine robot, we havethese muscles along its side, so as they inflate,they'll turn it one way. Then if I inflate theone on the other side, it'll turn the other way. [Derek] So the vine robotcan fit through tight spaces, it doesn't typicallyget stuck on anything, and isn't bothered by sharp objects. And once you attach thatcamera on the front, it's ideal for things like archeology. The robot was actually taken to Peru to investigate some very narrow shafts. So we were looking atthis archeological site that was built somewherebetween 1,500 and 500 BC in the Andes Mountains of Peru, and it was an ancient temple that had all these underground spaces. And part of what thearcheologists were doing was trying to understandwhat the spaces were for, and what the people who built them were trying to do with them. So part of that was unknown. But there were these giant roomsthat they called galleries, and then there were thesesmall ducts, or tunnels that were offshoots of these rooms, and they wanted to knowwhere these ducts led, but they were too smallfor a person to go in. So we were able tosuccessfully use the vine robot to explore three of the tunnels that couldn't have beenseen through other means, which was super exciting. And we got video inside the entire tunnels and gave it to the archeology team. [Derek] There's anapplication where I feel like this solution is just so obvious I wonder why it didn't exist before. Intubation is literally the process of putting a tube into a patient. The purpose is to breathe for the patient when the patient isn't breathing. And so traditionally, ahighly-trained medical professional would take their laryngoscope,come above the patient. And once they see the trachea, you start to pass your tube down inside. I'm almost there. I can see the light. So if you can see right now, I just got it in to the trachea. Oh, yeah.- Right there. And it took me a couple minutes, and I was really kindawrenching on this patient here. So if there's somebodywho's not breathing, every second counts. [Derek] But by using a miniature version of this vine robot, researchers are hoping to make intubation faster and safer. Somebody like me with no training could pretty simply insert this device, aim towards the nose, and just like that, if you cansee, we've already intubated, and all it took was a littlebit of pressurization. Just like that. [Derek] It almost lookslike a sort of a party favor. Yeah, right? It's like a, this remindsme a lot of those inflatable kinda like Play-Doh structuresthat you see at car lots. [Derek] How does it knowto go down the right tube? Yeah, so that's one ofthe kind of cool things about soft robotics, is therobot is quite compliant, and we see that in a lot of these demos. They can squish, they can bend. And so, how we've designed it is that the main robot growsdown into the esophagus, and then we have this side branch that heads towards the trachea, and it's quite flexible. And so, it basically finds the opening. So it's a really neat example of kind of a passive intelligence, mechanical intelligence,some people call it, where it can find its path even if we don't knowexactly the shape beforehand. [Derek] Have you triedthis on a real person yet? Not on a real person, but we've actually triedthis in a cadaver lab, and we've shown that we can move from this nice idealized versionto an actual in vivo situation and successfully intubate a patient. [Derek] There's another application, which is burrowing into sand or soil. When you blow compressed airinto something like sand, it fluidizes, it becomes like a liquid, and that can allow the vine robot to grow into granular materials like sand. If you've ever been to the beach and you try to stick yourumbrella pole into the ground, it's fairly difficult. I'll try to push thatprobe down into the sand, no fluidization. Yeah, it feels like it sortof gets wedged in there. So now I'll turn on the air. Oh yeah, you can feel it immediately. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's a lot. So what we've done here is essentially, we just blow a jet of airout the front of the robot, and that loosens up the sand enough to reduce the force of thesand so that the robot, just by tip extension,can make its way through. (air whooshing) (rousing music) This makes vine robotsan attractive option for NASA when they look for ways to study the surfaces of other planets. Recently on Mars, they triedto have a burrowing robot, but it got stuck. Could you do it betterbasically with this? Yeah, that's a good question. So the Mars InSight mission,they have this heat probe. The idea there was to be able to sort of hammer its way down into the core and then place a sensor that could detect the temperature of Mars. However, the problem they ran into there is that it turned out thematerial that they put it in was more cohesive than they expected. Inside the robot, somethingwould wind up and pound it down, wind up and pounded down. But it turned out therewasn't enough friction between the probe and the sand. So what was really happeningwas it would wind up, pound down, wind up, pounddown, wind up, pound down. So it'd never actually go anywhere. The advantage of somethinglike this, like tip extension, is you'd have your base,you start at the surface, and you just keep extending your way down. You're not necessarilyrelying on the interaction with what is surroundingit to make it work. [Derek] What amazes me about vine robots is how a plant inspiredthis simple, elegant design. It's so easy in fact thatyou could build one yourself in as little as a minute. There are instructionsonline that I'll link to. But from that basic design have come a huge variety of robots, with different applicationsfrom archeology to search and rescue, orintubation to space exploration. And what else can youthink of to do with it? I've actually gotten alot of emails from viewers about crazy ideas thatwe hadn't thought of. So keep 'em coming. We love to hear your ideas. Are there any ideasthat you can share with us that are like, oh, likethat's actually really cool? One idea was forclearing mines, landmines. So the idea was that you'd actually run a vine robot through the field and then detonate the landmines,and basically make a path that civilians couldwalk through the field. So I thought that was kind of a cool idea. Do you think they'dcreate enough pressure to trigger these things? I think the idea wasthey were gonna actually put explosives in thevine to detonate the, yeah, the land mines themselves. I mean, I'm also thinking,now that you mention that, like I'm thinking you couldput metal detector type sensors on the vine robot.- Absolutely. So spread them across the field and they'll pick up where the mines are. I'll give you another crazy example. Another one was for spaceapplications of docking, so two spacecraft docking together, you have to make an airtight seal. And so, the idea was, well, maybe you could use avine robot to do this. Some sort of like airlock orsomething going out and then. So basically, yeah, you can imagine the two tubes coming together, not sealed, and then the vine robot growing through and basically making the seal. Are there any updatesabout the vine robot? Like have the medicaltrials gotten anywhere? So we just did a trial with emergency medicalpractitioners using our device. We gave 'em five minutes of training, we gave 'em the device, and they were 90-ish percentsuccessful in intubating, in very rapid, something like 20 seconds. Oh, wow. The nice thing about our our device is that if it fails,it fails in 20 seconds. And so, it doesn't takethree minutes to attempt and then realize you didn't get it. I think something really nice about that is that it is so rapid and easy that even if it does fail,you get another shot. Yeah, I mean, that oneseems like it's so close to actually having a bigreal world application. I mean, how common are intubations? So intubations in the OR, so operating room are quite common. I think like 15 million a year. That's probably not our initial target 'cause those are veryreliable, like 99% plus. The fundamental problem isthat the tools are designed for those doctors in those scenarios. And what happens is those similar tools get put out into thefield for an ambulance and a paramedic is tryingto do an intubation, but they're doing it maybe in the dark, with someone in a poor body position, where there's blood in the mouth. So our device takesthat required skill out and basically lets the vine robot find the way into the trachea. And so, pre-hospital, there's around a millionintubations a year. And we think many intubationsthat aren't even attempted because the tools just aren't there. And then our kind oflong shot is eventually, there's AEDs, thedefibrillators everywhere. One issue there is there's not a way to help the person breathe. Possibly if we can makethis thing so simple, it could basically be packaged with a AED, where you could both get the heart going, and you could intubateand get the oxygen in. But I think we're close. It's pretty easy. You'll have to come backand get another video. We'll let you intubate a cadaver. That'll be fun. So we've kind of answered this question, but are these robots, vinerobots still being worked on? We have a projectright now on anchoring, especially we're interested in. So if you think of a plant root. If you ever try to pull out, I don't know, like a small shrub or something, it's incredibly hard, right? Like you're looking at this, it's got like a half an inch stem and you're pulling onit and pulling on it, it's like hundreds of pounds of force. So you're like how is this possible? And I think one of the coolest things is that a hundred poundsof anchoring force was created with almost noreaction force initially. There was like a seed thatslowly grew down into the ground. It's like all these little tendrils, and I'm imagining the frictionsums over all of those. So basically, when you'retrying to go into the soil, the thing resisting you isthe surface area of the tip. That's what you're pushing in. And then what's givingyou the anchoring force is the surface area on the sides. And so, you can imagine, ifyou clump 'em all together, the area in the tips doesn't change, but the surface areaof the sides went down. So you basically wanna split 'em up into as many, practically. So anyway, we're using that concept now to make these anchors, and we're working withNASA now one as well. And so, it's like this deployable anchor, it's very light. You could throw itsomewhere, or just drop it, and then the roots grow down, there's four roots thatgrow down into the ground, and it was something likea hundred Newtons of force to pull it out. Yeah, it sounds like avery sci-fi type thing, where you could likethrow the root pack down and it just like phmf, andthen the roots roots grow out and you're like, oh yeah,the anchor is locked in. Yep, absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, that's amazing. After seeing the unstoppable robot, we returned to Elliot's lab afew years later to see a robot that has conquered atotally different specialty, the art of jumping. This tiny robot weighsless than a tennis ball, and can jump higher thananything in the world. In the competitiveworld of jumping robots, the previous record was 3.7 meters, enough to leap a single story building. This jumper can reach 31 meters, higher than a 10-story building. It could jump all the way fromthe Statue of Liberty's feet up to eye level. For something to count as a jump, it must satisfy two criteria. First, motion must be createdby pushing off the ground. So a quadcopter doesn't count, because it pushes off the air. And second, no mass can be lost. So rockets constantly ejectingburnt fuel are not jumping, and neither is an arrowlaunched from a bow. The bow would have to come with the arrow for it to count as a jump. Many animals jump, from sand fleas, tograsshoppers, to kangaroos, and they launch their bodies into the air with a single stroke of their muscles. The amount of energy deliveredin that single stroke determines the jump height. So if you wanna jump higher, you have to maximize thestrength of the muscle. The best jumper in the animal kingdom is the galago, or bush baby, and that's because 30% oftheir entire muscle mass is dedicated to jumping. This allows the squirrel-sized primate to jump over two meters from a standstill. It has like very smallarms and upper body, and has just like huge jumping legs. It doesn't have bettermuscles or anything, it just has more of them. [Derek] There are someclever jumping toys. I feel like, there we go. Oh! I used to play withthese poppers as a kid. And when you deform a popper, you store energy in its deformed shape. Effectively it becomes a spring. And then, just like an animal, in one stroke, it applies alarge force to the ground, launching itself into the air. All elastic jumpersfollow the same principle of storing energy in a spring and releasing that energyin a single stroke to jump. But none of the jumping toys we had could compare to this tiny robot. Of all the things that Ihave ever tried to film, this is the most challenging. Because it's so small,it accelerates rapidly and travels a huge distance on each jump. Each takeoff happened fasterthan we could even register. Now, jumping might soundlike a niche skill, but engineered jumpers would be perfect for exploring other worlds, particularly where the atmosphereis thin or non-existent. On the moon, with onesixth the gravity of earth, this robot would be ableto leap 125 meters high and half a kilometer forward. Rovers may struggle withsteep cliffs and deep craters, but jumpers could hop in and out, fetching samples tobring back to the rover. And you don't lose muchenergy when jumping. So if you could store the kinetic energy back in the spring on landing, the efficiency could be near perfect. The team has already started to build an entire fleet of jumping robots. Some of them can rightthemselves after landing, so they can take off again right away. Others are steerable. They have three adjustable legs that allow the jumper tolaunch in any direction. Essentially what we've done is we've added three additionallegs that don't store energy but rather, allow it toform a tripod sort of that allows it to point a direction and launch in that direction. [Derek] But how does thisjumping mechanism work? Well, the main structure consists of four pieces of carbon fiber, bound together by elastic bands. Together, they create a spring that stores all the energyneeded for the jump. At the top of the robot is a small motor. A string wrapped around the axle is connected to the bottom of the robot. So when the motor is turned on, it winds up the string,compressing the robot, and this stores energy in thecarbon fiber and rubber bands. After about a minute and a half, the structure reaches maximum compression. How do you know when to put it down? Basically once the bottom there sticks inward and it can stand up, right now it would roll over, then you can put it down.- Got it. So as soon as you can. [Derek] And at this point,a trigger releases the latch that's holding the string on the axle. So all the string unspools all at once, and the energy stored inthe spring is released. Yeah. [Derek] The jumpergoes from a standstill to over a hundred kilometers an hour in only nine milliseconds. That gives an acceleration of over 300 Gs. That would be enough to killbasically any living creature. Watch out, watch out, watch out. But how does it jump so much higher than everything else, nearly 10 times higher thanthe previous record holder? Well, this jumper has threespecial design features. First, the jumper is incrediblylight, at just 30 grams. It achieves this weight by employing a tiny motor and battery. Plus, its entire structure, made of lightweightcarbon fiber and rubber, doubles as the spring. Per unit mass, natural latexrubber can store more energy than nearly any other elastic material, 7,000 joules per kilogram. And the design of the springmakes it ideal for its purpose. Initially they triedusing only rubber bands connected to hinged aluminum rods. But with this design, when compressing it, the force rises to apeak and then decreases. Just feels like it all of a sudden got a lot easier to pull. Another design withonly carbon fiber slats requires a lot of force to get started, and then it increases linearly after that. There is more and moreforce required to do this. The ultimate design is ahybrid of these two approaches. The benefit being, itsforce profile is almost flat over the entire range of compression. It feels like that needs a lot of force. And now it feels pretty steady with the amount of forcethat I need to apply. Therefore, it providesdouble the energy storage of a typical spring, where force is proportionalto displacement. The researchers argue this is the most efficientspring ever made. Sometimes a string'll snap. It's not always consistent that it releases when it's supposed to. Oof! The string cut it. Lemme go restring it. I'll be right back. [Derek] All right. You'd probably expect that lighter would always be better with a jumper, especially if the addedweight is simply dead weight rather than anything useful,like a spring or a motor. So we're adding basically achunk of steel to our jumper and it's gonna jump higher, and the key is that we'readding it to the top. You want your body,the part that's moving, to weigh at least as much as the foot. When your body's lighter,it's basically just collision, this energy transfer is very inefficient and you don't jump very high. But the real secret to how this jumper can achieve such heightsis through something the researchers call work multiplication. Unlike an animal, which can only jump using a single stroke of its muscle, an engineered jumpercan store up the energy from many strokes, or in this case, manyrevolutions of its motor, and that's how the motor can be so small. It doesn't have to deliverthe energy all at once. It builds it up graduallyover a few minutes. So the trade-off is kindof like time for energy. [Elliot] Exactly. [Derek] And this is possible because there is a latch under tension preventing the spring from unspooling until the robot is fully compressed. Interestingly, biologicalorganisms do use latches. For example, the sand flea, which can jump incrediblyhigh for its body size. It has a muscle that isattached, let's say, right here, is right inside of the pivot point. So as it contracts that muscle, the leg doesn't extend, right? It's actually closing it more. But then it has a secondmuscle that pulls it out. It's going to shift this muscle ever so slightly outside the pivot point. That's wild. So there's these twomuscles that are working. So here's your big power muscle. Here's your trigger muscle. It's a torque reversal mechanism. And then all of a sudden, it shoots. [Derek] But even though thebiological world has latches, no organism has developedwork multiplication for a jump from standstill,at least not internally. Spider monkeys have been observed pulling back a branch hand over hand using multiple muscle strokes stored in the bend of the branch to catapult themselves forward. There's a spider thatshoots out a silky string, which they pull back multiple times in order to slingshotthemselves to another location. So it's like slingshotting itself? Yes, they're calledthe slingshot spider. Now, I tried jumping in moon boots to see if they would help me go higher. (remarks drowned out by background noise) Okay. Oof. And it certainly felt like they did, but Elliot pointed outthat from a standing start, they don't actually help much. Kind of build it, buildit, build it, and then go. Okay. Only if you jump a few timesbefore can you store up some of the previous jumpsenergy in the elastic bands, and then that energy helps launch you higher on the following jump. For years, engineeredjumping was developed to mimic biological jumping. But with work multiplication,it gained an advantage. If you can generate alarge burst of energy simply by running a motor for a long time, the power of the motor is nolonger the limiting factor, the spring is. So you can focus on making the most powerful spring possible. This jumper has nearly maximized the achievable height with this spring. Assuming an infinitely light motor with infinite time to wind up, the highest possible jumpwith this compression spring is only around 19% higherthan what they've achieved. If you want to incorporate air resistance and play with aerodynamics, another way to send the jumper higher is to make it 10 timesisometrically larger, leading to a 15 to 20% higher jump. So we're in kind ofan intermediate scale where we still aregetting hit by air drag, but it's not as bad as the flea. If we went 10 times bigger, we could actually avoidair drag completely. This works since ifthe jumper is scaled up 10 times on all sides, the cross-sectional areaincreases by a hundred, which increases the drag force, but the jumper's massincreases by a thousand. So it has way more inertia, meaning the drag force affects it less. The entire concept of work multiplication could bring robots to the next level. Currently, motors and robotshave to be relatively small so they remain portable. But the simple principleof building up the energy from multiple turns of a motor over time would allow robots tostore and then release huge amounts of energy, and set some world records in the process. When we visited you, wewere looking at 110 feet and it was the record holder. My question, is that stillthe record as far as you know? It is. I also challenge allthe viewers to beat it, because it is beatable. So I hope someone in thenext few years will beat it, and if not, we'll beat our own record, because it's beatable. I will say that much. Are there more happeningwith the jumping robots? We have a whole notherproject on jumping, which we also think will beat it, and it doesn't even use spring. So I won't give away our secrets yet. But keep an eye out for that one too, 'cause that's gonna be fun. So you have another jumping robot, which has a totally novel design? Yep. And you think it's gonna be better than the one that you had before? Correct.- Wow, that's extreme. And in terms of makingthese things applicable? Yeah, so I mean, we dohave a project with NASA. I will say, our stuff withNASA moves pretty slow, just in terms of whatthey really care about is getting somethingreally, really reliable. If they're gonna send it tothe moon, it can't mess up. And so, that's a slow going process. But I just think that's still a goal, is to get it to the moon. It would be like the nextMars helicopter or something. I think that's a really good analogy. So the Mars helicopter hasjust been doing awesome, basically being this little scout that can just go outand get some nice views of where the rover might need to go, or maybe getting some samples. You can't have a helicopteron the moon, but you can jump. And we think we can getpretty similar performance in terms of height and stuff like that with jumping on the mooncompared to the helicopter. So yeah, no, that's a great analogy. Are there any interesting emails that came about fromthe jumping robot video? So a lot of people want to make one, and I will say, it's really hard, and I keep writing that it's really hard. Every piece in that robot was... They talk about safetyfactors in engineering where you're supposed tohave a good safety factor, and we had no safety factors in anything. And so, pretty much everythingwas near its failure limit. And so, that just made it incredibly hard. But what we're tryingto do actually right now is put together a tutorial to make like a, you know, it's not gonnajump a hundred feet, but it'll jump maybe 20 or 30 feet. Stay tuned for that, 'cause I think that wouldbe a fun way to get people to build one themselves and try it out. I will say though that ifyou really push the limits, what we're trying to do, wear your safety glasses andyour gloves, and all of that. Because the number ofshards of carbon fiber I've gotten into my fingers. Oh, no. Brutal. What is the biggest thing you learned building the jumping robot? How many things can go wrong when you're trying to buildsomething really cool. 'Cause this was yearsand years of failing, over and over, and over and over again. So I think something that sticks out to me is that it takes a lot of failure to get a success like that. Would anyone ever say to you, well, why did it take that many years? Could you not havemodeled out the springs, like done some simulations of it before you actually build the thing? Well, no, and I should mention too that it's not like we didn'tdo any modeling or simulation. That's all part of our cycle too. But the problem is, I mean, wedidn't even know what shape. We went through so many differentconfigurations of robots. Like some were kind of this ball shape, but we had other robotsthat were more stick like, rubber band based. It's like this crazysearch over a huge space, and comparing all kindsof different trade offs. I think that's a reasonable amount of time to make a world record,but that's just me. The jumper robot can jump so high precisely because it's builtof rubber and carbon fiber, with a tiny body and massive legs. Its whole body is designedfor one physical purpose. The specialization of robots is also natural in academic research, since it's easier forscientists to isolate and understand one ability. These may later be included into a single more complex robot. People expect sort of the Boston Dynamics, humanoid type robots. Why have you investigatedthese sort of other very strange looking type robots? The thing that maybeunifies all of them is, they're mostly aboutmechanical design, my robots, and less so about controls, and vision, and AI, and that side. And so, often we think of what we do are kind of adjacent to core robots. But our lab isn't as focusedon traditional robotics just because I find more joymyself in mechanical design. So that's what I like to do. Do you have a personal favorite robot? I can't play favorites with my robots. I know, it's like pickingamongst your children. Like it's just impossible. I love all my robots.I love all my robots. I will say though that thejumper, there was a certain, it took a lot of learningfrom our failures and revising it. And so, when we finallygot that one working, I think that was really satisfying. From your perspective,how did our collaboration come to be in the first place? Oh, wow. Okay. That's a fun story. So you sent me an email, Idon't know how many years ago, maybe five years ago, somethinglike this, and I ignored it. And I went into lab one day, Ijust mentioned to my student, I was like, oh, some guyemailed about making a video. And he is like, \"Yeah, who was it? Maybe I could help out or something.\" So I forwarded it to him, he's like, \"Do you know who this is?\" So then we responded. And we appreciated the effort you put in to the details in getting the story right. I forget how long we had this call. I had this call with Emily, it was maybe four hours or something. We went through thedetails of jumping theory. 'Cause she wanna get everything just right for that jumping video. As an academic, we care about that stuff and we want it to be right. But the most specialized perfected match between a robot's build in its abilities comes from one competitionthat's been refining this for nearly 50 years. Micromouse is the oldest roboticscompetition in the world. It's like the Formula 1 of robotics, but you have to see theirspeed to believe it. This tiny robot mouse can finish this maze in just six seconds. (rousing music) Every year around the world, people compete in theoldest robotics race. The goal is simple: get to the end of themaze as fast as possible. Person who came second (spectators cheering) lost by 20 milliseconds. [Derek] But competitionhas grown fierce. When somebody saw my design,they said, you're crazy. [Derek] Why is there so much tension? What's riding on it? Honor?- Honor. (spectators applauding) [Derek] In 1952,mathematician Claude Shannon constructed an electronicmouse named Theseus that could solve a maze. The trick to making the mouse intelligent was hidden in a computerbuilt into the maze itself, made of telephone relay switches. The mouse was just a magneton wheels essentially, following an electromagnet controlled by the positionof the relay switches. [Claude] He is now exploring the maze using a rather involvedstrategy of trial and error. As he finds the correct path, he registers theinformation in his memory. Later, I can put him downin any part of the maze that he's already explored and he'll be able togo directly to the goal without making a single false turn. Theseus is often referred to as one of the first examplesof machine learning. A director at Google recently said that it inspired the whole field of AI. 25 years later, editors atthe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, caught wind of a contestfor electronic mice, or le mouse electronique,as they had heard. They were ecstatic. Were these the successors Theseus? But something had beenlost in translation. These mice were just batteries in cases, not robots capable ofintelligent behavior. But the misunderstanding stuckwith them, and they wondered, why couldn't we hold thatcompetition ourselves? In 1977, the announcement for IEEE's amazing Micromouse Maze Contest attracted over 6,000 entrants. But the number of successfulcompetitors dwindled rapidly. Eventually, just 15 entrantsreached the finals in 1979. But by this point, thecontest had garnered enough public interest to be broadcast nationwide on the evening news. And just like the rumor thatinspired the competition, Micromouse began tospread across the world. \u266a Micromouse for the taking \u266a \u266a Micromouse, it's here and now \u266a \u266a Take a chance and start creating \u266a The Micromouse. [All] Micromouse! (upbeat music) Even people in the top two or three, you can see them tryingto set their mice up, and they can barely findthe buttons to press because it's absolutely nerve wracking. (suspenseful music) It doesn't matter what it was. It could be horse racing,it could be motor racing, it could be mouse racing. If you have a shred ofcompetitiveness in you, you wanna win, right? [Derek] Just like a real mouse, a micromouse has to be fully autonomous, no internet connection,no GPS or remote control, and no nudging it to help it get unstuck. It has to fit all its computing, motors, sensors, and power supply in a frame no longer orwider than 25 centimeters. There isn't a limit onthe height of the mouse, but the rules don'tallow climbing, flight, or any forms of combustion. So rocket propulsion forexample, is out of the equation. (whistle being blown) The maze itself is a squareabout three meters on each side, subdivided by walls into corridors only 18 centimeters across. And in 2009, the half-size Micromousecategory was introduced, with mice smaller than 12 anda half centimeters per side, and paths just nine centimeters across. The final layout of themaze is only revealed at the start of each competition, after which competitors are not allowed to change the code in their mice. (spectators applauding) The big three competitions,all Japan, Taiwan, and USA's APEC, usually limitthe time mice get in the maze to seven or 10 minutes, and mice are only allowed five runs from the start to the goal. So if you spend a lot of timesearching, that's a penalty. Makes sense. So the strategy for most micromice is to spend their first runcarefully learning the maze and looking for the best path to the goal, while not wasting too much time. Then they use their remaining tries to sprint down that path forthe fastest runtime possible. (spectators applauding) Solving a maze may sound simple enough, though it's important to remember that with only a fewinfrared sensors for eyes, the view from inside themaze is a lot less clear than what we see from above. Still, you can solve amaze with your eyes closed. If you just put one hand along one wall, you will eventually reachthe end of most common mazes, and that's exactly what some initial Micromouse competitors realized too. And after a simple wall following mouse took home gold in the first finals, the goal of the maze wasmoved away from the edges and freestanding walls were added, which would leave a simplewall following mouse searching forever. Your next instinct mightbe to run through the maze taking note of every fork in the road. Whenever you reach a dead end or a loop, you can go back to the last intersection and try a different path. If your last left turn got you nowhere, you'd come back to thatintersection and go right instead. You can think of this strategy as the one a headstrong mouse might use, running as deep into the maze as it can and turning back only whenit can't go any further. This search strategy, knownas depth-first search, will eventually get the mouse to the goal. The problem is, it mightnot be the shortest route, because the mouse onlyturns back when it needs to, so it may have missed ashortcut that it never tried. The sibling to this searchalgorithm, breath-first search, would find the shortest path. With this strategy, themouse runs down one branch of an intersection untilit reaches the next one, and then it goes back tocheck the path it skipped before moving on to thenext layer of intersections. So the mouse checksevery option it reaches, but all that backtracking means that it's rerunningpaths dozens of times. At this point, evensearching the whole maze often takes less time. So why not just do that? A meticulous mouse could searchall 256 cells of the maze, testing every turn and corner to ensure it has definitelyfound the shortest path. But searching so thoroughlyisn't necessary either. Instead, the most popularMicromouse strategy is different from all of these techniques. It's a search algorithmknown as flood-fill. This mouse's plan is tomake optimistic journeys through the maze, so optimistic in fact, that on their first journeytheir map of the maze doesn't have any walls at all. They simply draw the shortestpath to the goal and go. When their optimistic planinevitably hits a wall that wasn't on their map,they simply mark it down and update their newshortest path to the goal. Running, updating, running, updating, always bee lining for the goal. Under the hood of the algorithm, what the micromouse ismarking on their map is the distance from everysquare in the maze to the goal. To travel optimistically,the mouse follows the trail of decreasing numbers down to zero. Whenever they hit a wall, they update the numbers on their map to reflect the new shortestdistance to the goal. This strategy of followingthe numerical path of lease resistance gives theflood-fill algorithm its name. The process resemblesflooding the maze with water and updating values based on the flow. Once the mouse reaches the goal, it can smooth out the path it took and get a solution to the maze. However, it may look back and imagine an even shorter unchartedpath it could've taken. The mouse might not be satisfied that it's found theshortest path just yet. While this algorithm isn't guaranteed to find the best path on first pass, it takes advantage ofthe fact that micromice need to return to the startto begin their next run. So if the mouse treats itsreturn as a new journey, it can use the return tripto search the maze as well. Between these two attempts, both optimized to find the shortest pathfrom start to finish, it's extremely likely thatthe mouse will discover it, and the mouse will havedone it efficiently, often leaving irrelevant areas of the maze entirely untouched. Flood-fill offers both anintelligent and practical way for micromice to find theshortest path through the maze. Once there was a clear strategyto find the shortest path, and once the microcontrollers and sensors required toimplement it became common, some people believedMicromouse had run its course. As a paper published in IEEE put it, \"At the end of the 1980s, the Micromouse Contesthad outlived itself. The problem was solved and did not provide any new challenges.\" In the 2017 all-JapanMicromouse competition, both the bronze and silver placing mice found the shortest path to the goal. And once they did, theywere able to zip along it as quick as 7.4 seconds. (spectators applauding) But Masakazu Utsunomiya'swinning mouse, Red Comet, did something entirely different. This is the shortest path to the goal, the one that everyone took. This is the path that Red Comet took. It's a full five and a half meters longer. That's because micromice aren't actually searching for the shortest path, they're searching for the fastest path, and Red Comet's searchalgorithm figured out that this path had fewerturns to slow it down. So even though the path was longer, it could end up being faster. So it took that risk. (spectators applauding) It won by 131 milliseconds. Differing routes at competition are now more common than not, and even just getting tothe goal remains difficult, whether due to a mysterious algorithm or a quirk of the physical maze. [Announcer] On the corner,it's a little bit like a, whoa. [Derek] Micromice don'talways behave as you'd expect. Micromouse is far from solved, because it's not just a software problem or a hardware problem, it'sboth, it's a robotics problem. Red Comet didn't win because it had a better search algorithm, or because it had faster motors. It's cleverness came from how the brains and body of the mouse interacted together. So it turns out solvingthe maze is not the problem, it never was the problem, right? But it's actually about navigation, and it's about going fast. Every year, the robots getsmaller, faster, lighter. There is still plenty of innovation left. And there's a small groupof devotees in Japan busy building quarter-sized micromouse, which would sit on a quarter [Derek] Nearly 50 years on, Micromouse is bigger than ever. (spectators applauding) Competitions have appearedsolved at first glance before. The high jump was anOlympic sport since 1896, with competitors refining their jumps using variations like thescissor, the western roll, and the straddle over thedecades with diminishing returns. But once foam padding becamestandard in competition, Dick Fosbury rewrote the sport in 1968 by becoming the first Olympian to jump over the pole backwards. Now almost every high jumper does what's known as the Fosbury Flop. If Micromouse had indeedstopped in the 1980s, the competition would'vemissed its own Fosbury flops, two innovations that completelychanged how micromice ran. After all, a lot can change in a sport where competitors can solder on any upgrade they can imagine. The first Fosbury flop was one of the earliestinnovations in Micromouse, and had nothing to do with technology. It was simply a way ofthinking outside the box, or rather, cutting through the box. Every mouse used toturn corners like this. But everything changedwith the mouse, Mitee 3. The Mitee mouse three implemented diagonals for the first time. (spectators cheering) And that turned out tobe a much better idea than we really thought. And because it's cool, maze designers often put diagonals into the maze now. So, you know, you could endup with a maze where it never comes up, but most of thetime, it's actually a benefit. [Derek] In order to pull off diagonals, the chassis of the mouse had to be reduced to less than 11 centimeters wide, or just five centimetersfor half-size Micromouse. The sensors and software ofthe mouse had to change too. When you're runningbetween parallel walls, all you have to do ismaintain an equal distance between your left andright infrared readings. But a diagonal requiresan entirely new algorithm, one that essentially guides the mouse as if it had blinders on. Normally if you're goingalong the side of a wall or something like that, most of the time, you cansee the wall all the time. And so, that helps you to guide yourself, and you know when you're getting off. But in the diagonal situation, you just see these walls coming at you. [Derek] And if you veereven a tiny bit off course, snagging a corner is a lot less forgiving than sliding against a wall. Diagonals are still one ofthe biggest sources of crashes in competition today. But in exchange, a jagged path of turns transforms into one narrow straightaway. Whoa, whoa! (spectators applauding) (spectators applauding) (spectators cheering) [Derek] These days, nearlyevery competitive micromouse is designed to take this risk. Cutting diagonals opened uproom for even more ideas. Around the same time, mice were applying similarstrategies to turning. Instead of stopping and pivotingthrough two right turns, a mouse could sweep aroundin a single U-turn motion. And once the possibilityof diagonals were added, the total number of possibleturns opened up exponentially. The maze was no longer justa grid of square hallways. With so many more options to weigh, figuring out the best pathbecame more complex than ever. But the payoff was dramatic. What was once a series of stops and starts could now be a singlefluid snaking motion. How micromice imaginedand moved through the maze had changed completely. (spectators applauding) Available technology was getting upgrades over the years as well. Tall and unwieldy arms thatwere used to find walls were replaced by a smaller array of infrared sensors onboard the mouse. Precise stepper motors were traded in for continuous DC motors and encoders. The DC motors give you more power for less size and weight. And so, we were interested in doing that. So then you have to have a servo, you have to actually havefeedback on the motor to make it do the right thing. [Derek] Gyroscopes added anextra sense of orientation. It's like a compass.- Absolutely. You had this thing with you. They came about 'causeof mobile phones, really. So the technology provides people with things which weren't there before. All of the turning isdone based off the gyro, rather than countingpulses off the wheels, 'cause it's much more reliable. [Derek] But even with allthe mechanical upgrades, the biggest physical issue for micromice went unaddressed for decades. One thing you'll see almostevery competitor holding is a roll of tape. Once you know to look forit, you'll see it everywhere. This tape isn't for repairsor reattaching fallen parts. It's to gather specksof dust off the wheels in between rounds. At the speed and precisionthese robots are operating, that tiny change in frictionis enough to ruin a run. If you wanna turn while driving fast, you need centripetal force toaccelerate you into the turn. And the faster you're moving, the more force you needto keep you on the track. The only centripetal force fora car turning on flat ground is friction, which isdetermined by two things, the road pushing up the weight of the car, or the normal force, multiplied by the staticcoefficient of friction, which is the friction of the interface between the tire and road surface. This is why racetracks have banked turns. The steep angles help carsturn with less friction, because part of the normalforce itself now points in to contribute to thecentripetal force required. If the bank turn is steep enough, cars can actually make the turnwithout any friction at all. The inward component ofthe normal force alone is enough to provide the centripetal force required to stay on track. Micromice are no different, and they don't have banked turns to help. As they got faster andfaster, by the early 2000s, their limiting factor was no longer speed, but control of that speed. They had to set theircenter of gravity low and slow down during turns to avoid slipping intoa wall or flipping over. But unlike race cars, therewasn't anything in the rules to stop Micromouse competitorsfrom solving this problem by engineering an entirely new mechanism. Micromouse's second Fosbury flop was almost considered a gimmick when the mouse Mokomo08first used it in competition. You might be staring atthe video to try to see it, but you won't. Instead, it's something you'll hear. That isn't the mouse revving its engines. It's spinning up a propeller. And while flying over thewalls is against the rules, there's nothing in therules against a mouse vacuuming itself to theground to prevent slipping. Dave Otten was the first person I saw put a fan on a mouse,but he used a ducted fan, and I think he was really lookingat kind of reaction force, blowing the thing down. He had a skirt around, but itwas not terribly effective. He'll forgive for saying so. The idea is to let aslittle air in as possible. And like your vacuum cleaner, when you block your vacuum cleaner, the motor unloads and speedsup, and so the current drops. But if you let too much airin, the current's very high. And these are just quadcopter motors, and they draw a lot of current. [Derek] At the scale of Micromouse, a vacuum fan, often just builtfrom handheld drone parts, is enough to generate a downward force five times the mouse's weight. Wow, okay. That's impressive. So how much does the car actually weigh? About 130 grams. And if you listen, I dunno if you'll get iton your microphone, but. Oh, yeah.- You hear the motors slow down, loads up. [Derek] With that much friction, micromice today can turn corners with a centripetalacceleration approaching 6 Gs. That's the same as F1 cars. Once nearly everyone equipped fans, the added control allowed builders to push the speed limit on micromice. When it's allowed to, it will out accelerate a Tesla Roadster, but not for very far. [Derek] And they can zip along at up to seven meters per second, faster than most people can run. (spectators applauding) (spectators cheering) (spectators applauding) Every one of the features now standard on the modern micromousewas once an experiment, and the next Fosbury flopmight not be far off. The first four-wheeled micromouse to win the all-Japancompetition did so in 1988, but it would take another 22 years of the winning mouse growingand losing appendages before four wheeled mice became the norm. With micromice still experimenting in six and eight wheeled designs,omnidirectional movement, and even computer vision, who knows what the nextparadigm shift will be. [Announcer] Your time onthe maze actually begins only when you leave the start square. So he's not penalizedfor any of this time. But if you wanna getstarted with Micromouse, you don't need to worry about wheel count, or vacuum fans, or even diagonals. It is to my mind,the perfect combination of all the major disciplinesthat you need for robotics, and engineering, andprogramming, embedded systems, all wrapped up in one accessible bundle that you can do in your living room, and you don't need a laboratory to run it. You come along because you're curious. And then you think, I could do that, that doesn't look so hard. And then you're doomed, really. If it sucks you in, it turnsinto quite the journey. (spectators cheering) (spectators applauding) At its core, Micromouseis just about a mouse trying to solve a maze. Though nearly 50 years later, it's a simple problemthat's a good reminder, there is no such thingas a simple problem. \u266a Micromouse for the taking \u266a \u266a Micromouse, it's here and now \u266a \u266a Take a chance, start creating \u266a \u266a Micromouse will show you how \u266a A humanoid robot built for all the same tasks a human does sacrifices specialization in any one skill in order to be a generalist. But if it does all tasks semi well and these tasks are whathumans are already doing, well, then those robots arejust overlapping with us, copying our capacitiesrather than expanding them. So robots are perhapslikely to enter our lives not as multipurpose humanoids, but rather as precise toolswe can pick and choose. Instead of one Swiss army knife robot, you'd end up with somethinglike a personalized toolbox of specialized robots.

Elliot's vine robot and jumping robot are just two cases where the robots that might save our livesor explore new planets don't look much liketraditional robots at all. But soft robots in particularare an entire field of study. So why are so manyresearchers trying to build the robots of the futurewith soft materials? For one, trading outfragmented metal frames for single flexible bodies might be how we make robotsmore reliable and precise. These bendy gear boards are so predictable that they were commissionedby the US government to secure nuclear weapons, ensuring that no random motions could accidentally set them off. But predictability isjust one of eight reasons that machines that bend are better. What do this satellitethruster, plastic tool, and micro mechanicalswitch have in common? Well, they all containcomponents that bend, so-called compliant mechanisms. So it's always been considered to be bad to have flexibility in your machines. Well, we've tried to take thatthing that everybody hates and is trying to avoid and say, how can we use flexibilityto our advantage, how can we use that to do cool stuff? [Derek] Now, ProfessorHowell literally wrote the book on compliant mechanisms. That's the most cited book in-- [Derek] But he's prettynonchalant about his work. Just watch how he introducesthis mechanism he developed to prevent nuclear weaponsfrom going off accidentally. Actually the safing andarming of nuclear weapons. [Derek] What? And so, yeah, if you want. [Derek] Hang on, hang on. Hang on, hang on. What in nuclear weapons? Safing and arming. Safing and arming.- Yeah. So if there's anything in the world that you want to be safe, that is not going to accidentally go off. I feel like this is, itdoesn't even need saying. But yes, nuclear weapons, obviously you don't want them to go off. Well, I don't understand how this is gonna keep nuclear weapons safe. Now, I wanna come back to this device and explain how it works. Once we understand whycompliant mechanisms are best suited to this task. That's cool. So let's start with something basic. Probably the first compliantmechanism I ever designed was this thing. What it is, is a compliantmechanism that is a gripper. So you can put something in there and it'll get actuallya really high force. I can put that in thereand it breaks the chalk. [Derek] What if youput your finger in there and squeeze it? You would scream in pain. Would you like to try? I would.- Okay. [Derek] Like I would actuallylike to feel the force. Okay. You need to squeeze it yourself though. Really? Well, all right, I'll squeeze'til you scream in pain. But like don't, don't, don't. (Derek screaming in pain) That very quickly got incredibly painful. It felt like having myfinger like in a vice. That looks suspiciously like vice grips, but now with these flexiblecomponents where the hinges are. Hmm. What I learned in my visitwith Professor Howell is that compliant mechanismshave a number of advantages over traditional mechanisms. But I thought he needed kind of a clever, pithy way to rememberall of these advantages. So I came up with the eightP's of compliant mechanisms, and the first of those is part count. Compliant mechanismshave reduced part count, because they have these bendy parts instead of having things like hinges, and bearings, and separate springs. This gripper is just asingle piece of plastic, but achieves a similar result to the much more complicated vice grips. Like how much does it amplify the force? This will get about 30 to 1. So I could get, for 1 poundforce in, get 30 pounds out. [Derek] That's pretty good. It seems like that would be super cheap. And really inexpensive. So this we just made here in our shop, but you can imagine alsoinjection molding now. [Derek] That would cost like cents. Yep, this would cost cents. The other thing is, because of its shape, you could extrude it andthen just chop 'em off. Hmm.- And that would be cool. So the simple allows different production processes to beused, which lowers the price. These switches, for example, achieve in one piece of plastic what is normally donewith springs, hinges, and many rigid plastic pieces. Also a good fidget device. How long can these last? We've had these in ourfatigue testing machine, and we've been able to go over a million cycles without failure. What do we got there? All right, Derek, I've got a quiz. Uh-oh.- A quiz for you, okay? Elephant. Very good. Okay, I'm gonna push on theelephant's rump, this direction. I'm gonna hold this. So that little dot right there, is that dot, when I push on it, is it gonna go left, right, up, or down? (Derek laughing) I just, you know what, I wanted to guess withouteven thinking about it. Yeah, please do. I'm gonna say like up and in. Okay. Up and in. And I kind of feel like that because like that would be a logical way for an elephant to hold its trunk. But also because like ifthis is all going over, I feel like this is gonnakind of extend there and that's gonna get pushed up in there. Ah, ah, good thinking. Well, I don't know,is that good thinking? Well, it's thinking at least. So this is designed sothat when you push on that, it actually just rotates inspace, it doesn't move at all. I knew you were gonna pull some sort of trick question on me.- It's a trick question. [Derek] Now, since I was fooled by it, I had to try it out on myfriend, The Physics Girl. That's so trippy. That is so cool. I don't understand, what? It's modeled after themechanisms you use in wind tunnels where you want to have, say,a model that's attached here, but then you move itand all you want to do is control, its its angle and not move it around in the wind tunnel. Don't displace it, but beable to change the angle. Devices like this demonstratethat compliant mechanisms are capable of producingvery precise motion, which I personally foundpretty counterintuitive because these objects aremade up of flexible parts. But maybe that shouldn't be surprising, because compliant mechanisms don't suffer from backlash, for one thing. So backlash occurs when you have a hinge, which is basically just a pin in a hole, and it's moving in one direction. And now, if at some pointthe motion reverses, it doesn't happen instantaneously because there's some give in the hinge. This also causes wear,and requires lubricant. And that is why compliant mechanisms have better performance thantheir traditional counterparts. This one though is my favorite. That is one of my favorites too. It's just so pleasing, right? Oh, that sound is so satisfying. This actually, believeit or not, was inspired when we were doing thingsat the microscopic level, where we were buildingcompliant mechanisms on chips. We had to be able to makethese compliant mechanisms out of silicon, whichis as brittle as glass. And if you're trying tomake something like this out of glass, it's crazy hard. But that also means, oncewe figured out the design, we could make it in amaterial even like PLA, which is also not the idealcompliant mechanism material. So you can get on our website and get the files to make this yourself. [Derek] I'll put alink in the description. Yeah, that also has a nicefeel, and a nice snap to it. It has a really nice snap. I like when it comes out, it's like gunk. Like there's somethingabout that that's really, it's very pleasing. So these things actually move? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [Derek] I need to see this. Okay, all right, we'll do it. [Derek] Were those etched on there? Yeah, those are etched. And so, just using the same processes used to make computer chips. [Derek] So another advantageof compliant mechanisms is that they can be made with significantly smaller proportions, because they take advantage of production processeslike photolithography. [Larry] And we have motion that we want at the microscopic level. That's brilliant. Plus, since they simplify design, compliant mechanismsare much more portable, meaning lightweight, which makes them perfectfor space applications. This here is something we did with NASA, making a hinge that could replace bearings for, say, deploying solar panels. This is titanium, 3D-printed titanium. But what's freaky about it is, you get that motion, which people expect, but here's a piece oftitanium that can bend plus-minus 90 degrees,180 degree deflection. [Derek] That is solid titanium? That is one piece oftitanium that is 3D printed. [Derek] There's no alloy,nothing to make it flexible? Yep, this is, yep. And even freakier than this is this guy right there. So that looks like a crazy beast, but every part in there has a purpose. All these flexible beams. Here are the two inputs. And again, we did this withNASA for a thruster application, where we can put a thruster right there, and now, with our two motor inputs, we can direct thatthruster in any direction. That titanium device moves out, and you notice, it's just all bending. And then, there's no pinchpoints for the fuel lines, or electrical lines coming in. Here, this single piece of titanium allows you to use onethruster in place of two. Okay, that is a clutch.- Okay. So the idea is, if youspin it up really fast, because it's flexible, this outer part will actuallystart coming outwards. And then, if there's a drum around it, it'll contact with thatdrum and spin that thing. Oh, so this like kind of, oh, that kind of comes out like so. Then it gets spinning really fast, and then you essentiallyengage this outer drum. So this is like the waythat a chainsaw would work, or something like that, because you get it spinning fast enough and then it engages the chain,and then it turns it over and then, yeah.- The centripetal force. Yeah. Wow, that's cool. So here, this is made inplastic so that you can see it. But in reality, it'sgotta be a lot stiffer. So here it is made in steel.- What? So hang on, you're saying that that thing, which is made of steel,- Yep. you spin it up to a certain speed, and then it expands and engagesa drum that's around it? Yep, yep. So it'll idle with no motion, but then at a certain speed,what we designed it for, it'll speed up to that RPM. You speed it up and it engage? Yep. I had no idea. Like I have learned something today. So let's come back to thesafing and arming device for nuclear weapons. Its purpose is to ensurethat no random vibrations, say, from an earthquake, inadvertently disable safetiesand arm the nuclear weapon. Now, one of the requirementswas that this device be made as small as possible. They made those as smallas they possibly could using traditionalmethods, even using things like what the Swiss watchmanufacturers were using. With compliant mechanisms, they produced a device outof hardened stainless steel where some components werethe size of a human hair. This is high speed video. Here, the device is operating at 72 hertz, meaning this little hole makes two completerevolutions each second. The way it's meant towork is an arming laser shines on the rotor wheel, and when the proper inputis given to the system, the wheel rotates a notch. If all the proper inputs are given, then the hole lines up with a laser beam and crazy things happen from there. So it is essential thatthis device's performance is perfectly predictable, even if it sits unusedin a silo for decades. So are these now beingused on nuclear weapons? You know, it turnsout they don't tell us what they do with their nuclear weapons. And so, we designedthem, we made prototypes, we tested them, and then it goes whatthey call behind the fence where it's all classified, and you know, we don'tknow what happens, so. But these soft components by themselves aren't truly robots. It's only once you combinethem with computers that you get robots whichcan autonomously form crazy shapes or new styles of movement, all because they bend. But how do they work, and why would you want a softrobot in the first place? So I came up to Stanfordto meet Zach Hammond and his soft robot. Hey, Derek.- How's it going? [Derek] All right, you wanna tip it? So is the idea that therobot could walk this way? Totally, yeah. So you can kinda chainthese roles together to kind of roll around in any environment. They call this punctuatedrolling locomotion, wherein it's kind of stuck on a face until it tips over, andnow it's on a new face, and it can then continue tomove its center of gravity. Once that center of gravityexits the support polygon or the base, then it tips overone of the edges of the face. [Derek] This is a different soft robot made out of flexible tubing. It was designed to mimicthe way a turtle walks, where diagonally oppositelegs move together. It's powered entirely by compressed air, and perhaps most impressive,it requires no electronics. All of the circuitry is pneumatic. And this means the robot canbe used in places like mines, where electronics could spark explosions, or in the strong magneticfields around MRI machines. But why would you want a softrobot in the first place? One of the things that I like to do is just to take the robot and kind of like beat it up a little bit, show how it's compliant and compressive. [Derek] Well, because they're safer. If you'd like to takea whack at it, feel free. But this is your work. I don't wanna break it obviously. No, feel free. Go for it. For operation around humans, there's not much damage asoft robot can do to you. I can stand on these? Yep. This is a pretty crazy compliant robot. Because the fundamental structure of this robot is compliant, there's only some maximum force that it could ever exert on me. So it's inherently safe tobe operating around people. [Derek] Could we make itfall and have me be inside it? Yeah, yeah, we could do that for sure. Just watch your head. Yep. If I go over here. If you're there, yeah, we can do that. All right, let's try it. Here it comes. Well, that's not bad at all, is it? [Zach] I can try another shape that's supposed to openup one of the faces so you can jump out of it quickly. Okay. [Zach] I haven't testedit in a little while, so I dunno how it's gonnago, but let's try this. There you go, that's it. Face right there to your right, and you can exit the truss from that face. Boom, just that easy.- Perfect. [Derek] Did you build this by yourself? Me and one other grad student built this entire thingourselves basically. [Derek] And how long did it take? [Zach] We did it in abouta month, I want to say, like actually constructing everything. [Derek] And was it tricky? I mean, were you sewing that stuff? Yep, we sewed this all ourselves. [Derek] The main structuralmembers of this robot are fabric tubes inflated with air. Yeah. So these redtubes are a nylon fabric, and then internally thereis a polyethylene tube that provides the air tightness. [Derek] The tubes are inflated to about six PSI above atmospheric. So it's almost one and a half atmospheres. Each tube passes through pairs of rollers connected to a motor. The rollers pinch the tube so it bends kinda like a pinched straw. Have the rods, and then we have this likehigh friction material wrapped around the rods. And then that coupled with the fact that we have this pressurizedtube that's kinda pushing the membrane of the tube into the rollers prevents us from slipping. [Derek] By driving the motor, it changes the lengths of the tubes. Kind of like when a clowncreates a twist in a balloon and then folds that ballooninto a balloon animal. The difference between whatthe clown does and what we do is that there's some passage of air between adjacent segments of the tube, so that as the robot drives around, we're not pressurizingthe segments of the tube. [Derek] This robot ismade of four inflated tubes, each one connected to a pair of motors, forming triangular sides. We also think that they kindof look like sausage links when put together, which iswhy we've named these robots after different sausages. So this one's called Polish. That one over there is Chorizo. There's a Linguica, and aKielbasa over there somewhere. [Derek] So what shapeis the overall thing? It's an octahedron? Yeah, we call it an octahedron, because if you drew lines between these kind ofkinematic joints here, it would create an octahedron shape. Driving the motorstogether allows the robot to dramatically change shape. It can get very tall, or short and squat. But since the tubes themselvesdon't change in length, the overall perimeter of the robot, the length of all the edgescombined, doesn't change. So the robot is considered isoperimetric. How do you feel when you watchthose Boston Dynamics videos? Oh, I love thosevideos. They're so cool. The Boston Dynamics robotsare kind of terrifying. Like isn't the idea with soft robots to like convince people thatrobots are good, and soft, and kind, and friendly, and safe? That's that's definitely true, yeah. There are some things thatyou can do to rigid systems to make them feel like compliant systems based on how you'recontrolling the motors. But yeah, they'redefinitely heavy, expensive, and can be dangerous ifthey're not used correctly. [Derek] The hard robots we're used to are strong and precise. Their actions are accurate and repeatable, but they are also heavy, and they can't really changetheir volume as dramatically. But this robot is still capableof carrying a heavy load. So I have a GUI in MATLAB- Oh, nice. that enables me to just put in the positions that I wantthe robots to move in inches and then send them out. There's some other functionality. I have some stored configurationsto send to the robots. [Derek] Soft robotsalso have the advantage of shape changing. They can become tall to go over obstacles, or short to fit under obstructions. So if there's somerock that it didn't see, or that it wanted to rollover, it could simply do that, and the compliance of the tubes would simply just bendaround that disturbance. Do you imagine robots likethis doing work in space? Oh yeah, definitely. So one of the nice thingsabout these types of structures is that they can shrink downtheir volume very drastically. And because volume on rocketsis such an expensive premium, being able to have a robot that can pack down small fortransport is very valuable. So NASA was at one pointlooking into trust robots for exactly that reason. And they've contacted ussince we've made this robot to explore different ideas forspace exploration projects. So one of the things thatthey're thinking about doing is deploying robotsunderneath a sheet of ice. So they're gonna drillthrough this sheet of ice and then deposit a robot through what is kind ofa small diameter hole. And so, if you can have a robot that can change itsvolume very drastically, or be disassembled and then reassembled to form a much larger structure, then you can have large robots that are able to fitthrough these tight spaces and be deployed indifficult to access areas. Is this a little bit like an octopus? Is that how you can think of it? There is some connection there, because they use theirshape changing ability and their compliance to squeezethrough tight passageways, and then also to wraptheir body around objects. So for example, they can openjars with their tentacles. And one of the things thatwe want to use this robot for is grasping and manipulating objects. [Derek] This robot is even capable of picking objects up off the ground. We'll try that andsee if it can grab it. Because of the compliance of the tubes, it has a natural ability tograsp and manipulate objects, because as it does so, thetubes bend ever so slightly, which increases the contact area and distributes evenly the forces that are exerted on that object. [Derek] So I mean, is thebiggest risk if it pops? Yeah, that's a big risk. I mean, you obviouslyneed the compressed air for your structure. And so, if you have a leak. (air whooshing) Oh. Then you don't have a robot, right? [Derek] It's a pretty bigdrawback of soft robots. Some things that youcould do to mitigate that would be to have onboarda small compressor, which isn't there toprovide power to the robot, but would help you maintain pressure if there were any small leaks. [Derek] When you tell someoneyou're working on a robot and they see this, doesit defy expectations? Totally. They have no idea whatit is I'm talking about until I show them likea video or a picture. I think most people'sconception of soft robots was really expanded bythe movie \"Big Hero 6.\" And I think they did a great job in kind of showcasingwhat a soft robot can do and why they're useful, and kind of just popularizing the notion. It's really great to have compliance built into any mechanical system, especially as we want robots to work closer and closer with humans. So I think we'll definitely see more soft robots in the future. So maybe robots willenter our daily lives sooner than we think, just not in multipurpose humanoid form. In fact, one specialty robotis already becoming widespread, the glorious Roomba, builtfor maximum vacuuming. Do you think the way that robots integrate themselves into our lives will be like a humanoidrobot in your house, or will it be specialized little things that we don't even think ofas robots but they sort of? Slowly infiltrate, yeah. I think probably the latteris gonna happen first, would be my guess. I mean, little things like, yeah, like things just start getting smarter, whether it's your shoes,your watch, or your car, your thermostat, all those things, and then before like yourmaid shows up as a robot. By dropping the human model of a robot, instead we can choosethe best possible shapes and materials that maximizespecific abilities. And with this method,we've already built robots that can save your life, leap tall buildings in a single bound, move with super speed,protect your valuables, and shapeshift. You know, come to think of it, they'd make a pretty good superhero team."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: mysterious disappearance of Amelia Earhart"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Amelia Earhart knew she was in trouble. Over the radio, she called, \"We must be on you but cannot see you. Gas is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet.\" Beneath her was water in every direction asfar as the eye could see. She got herself into this predicament through a series of unfortunateevents and bad decisions. Many of them could have been avoided with a better knowledge of physics. But even so, there was one thing she couldhave done in this moment, one switch she could have flipped that would likely have savedher life and changed history. This video is sponsored by KiwiCo. More about them at the end of the show. Amelia Earhart was vying tobecome the first female pilot to fly around the world. I hope to accomplish something really scientificallyworthwhile for aviation. And she wasn't taking any shortcuts. Other successful circumnavigations had followed a northern route, mostly staying close to land. But Earhart's route would be the longest by following a path close to the Equator. This meant the last part ofher journey was the hardest, crossing the full widthof the Pacific Ocean. The starting point forthis crossing was Lae, a city on the eastern side of New Guinea. At the time, it was one ofthe world's busiest airports, a hub of traffic from Asia and Australia. At 10:00 a.m. on a hot July day, Earhart piloted her LockheedElectra down the runway and took off on whatwould be her final flight. The Pacific Ocean is huge. It's way bigger than the Atlantic. I mean, if you look atthe globe from that side, you see almost no land. The problem was, in 1937, most planes could only fly a maximum of a few thousand kilometers, so Earhart removed everythingunnecessary from her plane. She ripped out theinsulation to reduce weight, but that made the enginenoise so overwhelming she had to communicate with her navigator sitting right beside her using written notes. She packed almost nothing,telling her husband, \"Extra clothes and extra food would have been extraweight and extra worry.\" She replaced the passengerseats with fuel tanks, effectively turning herplane into a flying gas can. But even so, the Electra's maximum range was between 6,600 and 7,200kilometers in perfect weather. It could be just enoughto reach Hawaii from Lae, or she might come up disastrously short. So Earhart needed a place tostop and refuel along the way. Now, it might seem likethere's no land here, but if you zoom in, there is this tiny island halfway between Australia and Hawaii. Howland Island is justover two kilometers long and less than one kilometer wide. The US had claimed it as part of the Guano Islands Act of 1856. But in 1937, it was barely inhabited with just a handful of colonists. It would be an ideal location to refuel, if only it had a runway. Fortunately for Earhart, by the time of heraround the world flight, she was already famous. In 1928, she became thefirst female passenger to cross the Atlantic by airplane. This made her an international celebrity. [Announcer] She saidshe could, and she did it. (lively music) [Derek] But she wantedto fly herself, saying, \"Maybe someday I'll try it alone.\" So, in 1932, she attempted to pilot aplane solo across the Atlantic heading for Paris. She brought with her only a toothbrush, one container of soup andthree cans of tomato juice. (thunder booms) But storms, ice, and densefog battered her small plane. A seam in the exhaust manifold cracked and flames from the enginespewed out into the night. Gas leaked down herneck from a broken tank, and after 14 hours, she landed in a pasturein Northern Ireland. Her face was so covered in grease, a farmhand couldn't tell ifshe was a man or a woman. He asked if she had flown far. \"From America,\" she replied. I wish I could have done it faster. [Derek] These adventures brought her into the orbits of powerful people, like the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. And Mrs. Roosevelt, won't you go for a ridetonight over Washington? It's really lovely from the air at night. And using her new connections, she lobbied the president tohire her friend, Eugene Vidal, to head the Bureau of Commerce. Vidal had promised Earharta runway on Howland Island, but red tape stalled progress only months before her planned takeoff. So Earhart wrote directlyto President Roosevelt. She explained that the airstrip funds required immediate approval, writing, \"Please forgivetroublesome female flyer for whom this HowlandIsland project is key to world flight attempt.\" The president approved theproject four days later, and three runways were soon cleared. So she had a place to land, but how would she find thistiny speck of an island in a vast ocean? Well, flying with her in the Electra was her navigator, Fred Noonan, and he would calculate the flight plan. They knew the direction of Howland, so they could use the onboard compass to set their bearing toward it. They knew their air speed and could figure out their ground speed by subtracting or adding the wind, and then they could calculatehow long it should take to reach the island. This method is known as dead reckoning. But they wouldn't aimdirectly at the island, because if they did that and they didn't see itat the prescribed time, they wouldn't know in whichdirection they were off. So instead, theyintentionally picked a point either north or south of the island. Let's say they picked south. They estimated the tripwould take 18 hours, so they would fly through day and night. And once they had traveled for the calculated length of time, they could confidently turnnorth and spot the island. Before takeoff, the ground crew estimated they would encounter a headwindof 24 kilometers per hour. But just 20 minutes after takeoff, Lae radioed Earhart to warn that the headwinds would be stronger. She didn't acknowledge their message. Knowing the correctwind speed was critical because it would affecthow long it would take to reach the island. If it took longer, Earhartwould have to turn later. So she couldn't relyon dead reckoning alone to reach Howland. As an independent check on their location, Noonan would take measurementsof the sun, moon, and stars. This is known as celestial navigation. He had an almanac thatlisted 58 navigation stars and the point on Earth eachone would be directly overhead for the day and time of his measurement. If they found themselvesdirectly under a navigation star, well, then they wouldimmediately know their position. But generally theywould not be that lucky, so Noonan would measurethe angle above the horizon to a navigation star and use that to work outhow far away they were from the point on the Earth where that star wouldbe directly overhead. So he could trace outa circle on the globe of possible locations, and then he would measure the angle to another navigation star and draw out a second circle. And now they must be at one of these two circle intersections. Normally the circles were so large that only one of the intersections would be a plausible position. That way they could continuallyupdate their location and adjust bearings as needed. But even with celestial navigation, errors could accumulate over long trips. Earlier in the journey, whenEarhart crossed the Atlantic, they missed their intendedairport in hazy conditions. Noonan's calculations were reasonable, but small errors put them off course. Luckily, in Africa, there were plenty of otherplaces to land safely. The same could not be said for Howland. So, for the flight across the Pacific, Earhart commandeered three USNavy and Coast Guard ships. The Itasca would bestationed at Howland Island, the Ontario would behalfway along the route, and the Swan was positioned midway between Howland and Hawaii. The Itasca would send out smoke signals as Earhart approached tohelp her spot the island. But even more importantly, all ships were equipped with radio. Now, in 1937, radio wasstill fairly new tech. German physicist HeinrichHertz discovered radio waves in the late 1880s. He excited electrons tooscillate back and forth in his transmitter, and a few meters away hisreceiver was a loop of wire with a small gap in it. When Hertz looked at it througha microscope in the dark, he saw faint sparksjumping across the gap. The sparks were strongest whenthe receiving loop was flat. If it was vertical, thenno sparks were observed. This demonstrated that radiowaves are transverse waves with electric and magnetic fields oscillating perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to thedirection of the wave motion. When the receiving loop was aligned with the direction the wave was traveling, the changing magneticfield through the loop induced an EMF that created the spark. But if the loop wasfacing the transmitter, then there was no change inmagnetic flux through the loop, and so no spark was observed. Now, Hertz couldn't see thefuture he had ushered in. He said, \"I do not think that the wireless waves I have discovered will have any practical application.\" But within a few years, people started sendingmessages using radio. And by the 1920s, radioentertainment broadcast took off. Ships and planes routinelyused radio to send Morse code, and some, including Earhart, could send and receive voice messages. In fact, Earhart had five radioantennas around the plane, each for a specific purpose. The largest antenna couldbe reeled in and out like a fishing line behind the plane. It was 76 meters long, which was necessary to efficiently send and receive Morse code via the 4 or 500 kilohertz radio waves used by ships and remote stations. Ideally, an antenna should beat least 1/4 of the wavelength of the radio wave it'stransmitting or receiving. This improves the efficiency of the conversion from electrical energy to radiated electromagnetic energy. Earhart's trailing antenna was only around 1/8 of the wavelength. But it was connected toa high-power transmitter, so its signals could still be detected over 1,000 kilometers away. Next were two antennasfor voice communications on higher frequencies. A transmitting V antennaon the roof of the plane and a receiving antenna along its belly. Higher frequencies wereuseful for two reasons. First, they require smaller antennas, which save weight and canbe better accommodated on small sparse planes. And second, high frequency radio waves can travel long distances by bouncing off a layer of the atmosphere called the ionosphere. Starting about 50 kilometersabove Earth's surface, radiation from the Sun splitselectrons off molecules forming a layer of ionsand free electrons. Radio waves with certain frequencies interact with these free electrons and are effectivelyreflected back to Earth. It's as if they've bounced off a big wobbly mirror in the sky. This effect is called skipping and it scatters radiowaves all over the place. These radio waves canthen reflect off the ocean and back off the ionosphere, making multiple hops to travelthousands of kilometers. During the daytime, the intense radiation from the sun means the ionosphere startslower in denser atmosphere. And because of this, lower frequency radiowaves are more likely to be absorbed than reflected. So aviators would typicallyuse the higher 6210 kilohertz to skip their signals during the day, and then the lower 3105 kilohertz at night once the bottom of theionosphere had lifted into thinner air. Four hours after takeoff, Earhart radioed an update to Lae on her daytime frequency of 6210. She reported her altitude at 7,000 feet and speed at 140 knots before concluding with her typical sign-off, \"Everything okay.\" But she never acknowledged calls from Lae about the headwind. They radioed again at 11:20 and 12:20, but never got a response from Earhart. In all likelihood, she never heard them. She did radio six hours into her flight to report stronger headwinds, but she makes no mentionof Lae's earlier warnings. It's possible the receiving belly antenna was broken, fell off, or something in the receivingelectronics wasn't working. But her ability to receive voice messages was clearly impaired. Nine hours into the flight, Earhart expected to come upon the Ontario. She listened for Morsecode Ns on 400 kilohertz, but she heard nothing. The original plan was that the Ontario wouldwait for her to radio them to request that they start transmitting. But the day before takeoff, Earhart realized she had made a mistake. The Ontario had told her they wouldn't be able to receiveany high frequency signals, which meant no voice communication. So she sent an urgenttelegram asking the Ontario to transmit the Morse code Ns repeatedly 10 minutes after each hour. The purpose of the Morsecode from the Ontario was actually to allow Amelia Earhart to make use of her two final antennas. So she had a loop antennajust like this one and a sense antenna. These were designed to allow her to locate the source of radio waves. This was the final and most critical way that Earhart planned to stay on course and locate Howland Island. She wrote, \"I doubt if I'd try the flight to tiny Howland Island without it supplementingFred Noonan's skill.\" Woo. Alright, so I have an antenna here and I'm aligning itvertically in this tree. How are we, how are we there? So the Ontario was sendingout Morse code signals on their antenna, and here we have a transmittertuned to about 3.6 megahertz. I'm gonna put on this blindfold and use the loop antenna totry to locate the transmitter. And because I already knowwhere the transmitter is, we'll spin me around a fewtimes to really disorient me. So, Clifford. Oh, sorry. [Clifford] Oh, which way are you going? Alright. Whoa, I'm a bit dizzy. So the radio waves are gonnabe emitted in all directions radially away from the antenna, the electric field will beoscillating up and down, and the magnetic field willbe oscillating back and forth. So if I hold up this loop like this sort of parallel to the direction that the waves are traveling, then the magnetic fieldis gonna be changing through the loop. And because of that, it's going to create an EMF and current and I can pick that up because I'm tuned to theright frequency here. So I got a fairly strong signal. Woo, it's very strong. But if I rotate the loop like that, well, now the magnetic fieldis oscillating back and forth but not changing through the loop itself because it's parallel to the loop. And so, in this orientation,I'm gonna get a null reading. If I turn it this way, there's a null. But if you turn it 90 degrees, now all the magnetic fieldis passing through this loop and so I can hear a maximum here. So this is what Earhart wanted to measure using her loop antenna to detect the repeated NMorse code from the Ontario. She would turn it until she found the null and then she would knowthe direction to the ship. Something that's interestingis, if I turn it away, we get another null because again there's no magnetic fluxpassing through this loop. Now, the first time shepicked up the signal, she would probably be headingstraight towards the ship or close enough, so she would know thatit's roughly that way. But there's a chancethat she's gone past it. And if you go past it, well,then you also get a null, but the ship is behindyou, not in front of you. So that's where thesense antenna comes in. The sense antenna gives youa cardioid pickup pattern so it has a single nullinstead of two nulls, and so that allows you to determine whether it is in front or behind you. [Clifford] If you walk a bit, you'll know if it'sgetting weaker or stronger. Alright, I feel like I'vepicked the wrong direction. I'll try the sense antenna tosee if I can figure it out. With the sense antenna, the only null points directlyaway from the transmitter, so it's easy to use the sense antenna to check which null is correct but then only use the loop when navigating because it gives a sharper null. I think using the sense antenna that the transmitter'sright in front of me now. I'm looking for another null here. Oh, there's a null. [Clifford] Give it a go. There, there. Definitely louder, louder. Oh, it's funny 'causeyou move a little bit and then you start hearing signal again. This does not feel like I'mwalking in the right direction. [Clifford] Well, that'seither the right way to go or it's the wrong way to go. Oh no.(Clifford laughs) Trying to fly a plane anddo this would be very hard, especially with the sound of that engine would have been roaring. Oh, I feel like it's getting loud. It's really loud here. It drops out right there. I mean, there's a null here. And I was convincedthis was the right way. Yeah, this is a clear null right here. Whoa. Loud, loud, loud. I feel like I've gotta be close. (antenna humming) It's gotta be like right here. Whoa! Ah! (laughs) This worked amazingly well. I had no idea I was thatclose, that's impressive. On the nail.- That's awesome. Now, aviators could have usedwhere the signal is loudest and try to go in that direction, but it's actually easierto get a precise null, a point where the signal drops out. The loud section couldrange for quite a distance and so you wouldn'treally know where it is, but the null is more precise so that's why theywould look for the point where the signal drops out. If Earhart could hone in on the Ontario using her radio direction finding loop, that would ensure she was on course and eliminate any navigation errors that may have occurred to that point. But her telegram asking the Ontario to transmit 10 minutes after each hour didn't make it to the ship in time. And since Earhart couldn'ttalk to the Ontario, they never sent out any signals. So they passed like ships in the night. By this point, Earhart wasaround halfway to Howland. With no other landing stripswithin 1,000 kilometers, she would have to find the tinyisland or return to Lae now. But multiple delays hadalready plagued her journey. In fact, this was notEarhart's first attempt to fly around the world. Earlier that year, in March of 1937, she had taken off fromCalifornia for Hawaii, heading west instead of east. On board were Fred Noonan and another crew member, Harry Manning. As a Merchant Marine captain, he was an expert in radio, Morse code, and traditional navigation. He was also a pilot. The flight to Hawaii was successful thanks in part to Manningusing the loop antenna to hone in on a radio beaconon the destination island. Three days later, the trioset off for Howland Island. But just as they were taking off, the plane drifted to the right. Earhart corrected bythrottling back the left motor, but it was too much. The plane turned to the left and the right wing dipped down. Going up on one wheel, theright landing gear collapsed, then the left. The plane skidded out on its belly, spinning around to facethe way it had come. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but the Electra took months to repair. And during that time, theseasonal winds shifted. So, on her next attempt, Earhart would have tofly east instead of west. And most importantly, CaptainManning left the crew. Officially, the press reported that he needed to returnto the Merchant Marines, but rumors spread that he hadlost confidence in Earhart, or that Earhart believed Noonan was a better navigator than Manning and she could operatethe radio on her own. Whatever the case, when Earhart took offagain three months later, she was accompanied only by Noonan. And now they had made it 80%of the way around the world. And in the dark of night, Earhart had to make the critical decision whether to keep going or turn back. The lack of signal from the Ontario must have been concerning, but maybe they never got her telegram. And she knew that at Howland, the Itasca would betransmitting the letter A over Morse code every half hour, even if they didn't hear from her. And they could send andreceive voice signals. They promised to be ready on a range of different frequencies. So she flew on. Around 6:15 a.m. local time, radiomen aboard the Itascaheard Earhart clearly. \"Please take a bearing on 3105. We'll whistle into the mic. We are about 200 miles out.\" She then began to whistle. But the men were confused. They expected Earhart totake a bearing on them, not the other way around. And while they had told her that they had radiodirection finding equipment, the signal needed to be lower frequency, between 270 and 550 kilohertz. Her voice frequency wouldskip off the ionosphere and reflect off the ocean, scattering in all directions. So there would be no way to find a null because the signal would be coming literally from everywhere. In the Electra, Earhart heard only static. By now, she must have been worried that they hadn't heardanything from either ship. Almost blind from the rising sun and deaf from the roar of the engines, Earhart twisted the radio dial, listening for Itasca's response. Nothing. She may have expected Howland to have a high frequencyradio direction finder called an Adcock antenna array. These systems solve the skipping problem with five vertical antennas at the corners and center of a square. The direction of the radio wave can be calculated from theslightly different arrival times and signal strengths at each antenna. But these antennas were massive, so they were really onlyinstalled at larger airports. Now, as it happens, there was a portable highfrequency radio direction finder on Howland Island, but the operator reportedthat Earhart's transmissions didn't last long enoughfor him to take a bearing. And trying to conserve his low battery, he missed parts of thelater transmissions. Around 6:45, Earhart again asked them to take a bearing on 3105 kilohertz and report back in a half hour. But a bearing taken now andreported back in a half hour would be at best outdatedand at worst misleading. This confusion likely hadto do with time zones. Earhart was using Greenwich Civil Time, but the Itasca set their clocksto their current position which was GCT -11.5 hours. And to make matters worse, Howland Island used Hawaii Time, which back in those dayswas GCT -10.5 hours. So the three partiesattempting a rendezvous on a tiny island in themiddle of the Pacific were on three different time zones. And crucially, Earhart'shours didn't even line up with the others. Earhart told the Itascashe would be using GCT, but somehow it nevermade it to the radiomen. So, when the Itascaheard Earhart's request, it was 6:45 a.m. But in the cockpit, it was 6:15 p.m. So Earhart likely didn'tsay \"in a half hour\" but \"on the half hour,\" which for her was only 15 minutes away. And also it was a prearranged time that Earhart would be listening for them. Earhart was careful to settimes she would transmit and times she would listen for the ship because she could onlypower one antenna at a time. And the ships used the same antenna for receiving and transmitting, so if they both broadcastedat the same time, they would miss each other's messages. If Earhart sent another message at a quarter after the hour, the Itasca blocked itwith their own message. \"Cannot take a bearing on 3105 very good. Please send on 500, or do youwish to take a bearing on us? Go ahead please.\" There was no response. But she couldn't transmiton 500 kilohertz anyway because she had removedthe long trailing antenna that could transmit lower frequencies. Since it could only beused for Morse code, something neither she nor Noonan were particularly well versed in, she saw it as dead weightafter Manning left. So, after the Hawaii crash,it was removed during repairs. So she had no way of sending radio waves that would allow the Itascato take a bearing on her. But she could take a bearing on the Itasca using her loop antenna, if they sent her the right frequency. Before the trip, theItasca had asked Earhart to specify the frequencythey should broadcast. Earhart was unsure, so she consulted a radio expert in Lae and they recommended theItasca send Morse code A, just repeated dot dashes, on the half hour at 750. But at that time it was typicalto talk about radio waves using their wavelength, so the expert had meant 750meters or 400 kilohertz. But Earhart made a terrible mistake relaying this plan to the Itasca. She requested the signalbe sent on 7,500 kilohertz instead of 750 meters or 400 kilohertz. But she did explicitly say, \"If frequencies mentionedunsuitable, inform me.\" But no one ever corrected her. At 7:42 a.m., Earhart's voice came through so loud men even went above deck tosee if they could hear a motor or spot the plane. She said, \"We must be onyou but cannot see you. But gas is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet.\" On Howland, the high frequencyradio direction finder was so low on battery the radiomen didn't evenhear Earhart's message, much less take a bearing on it. 10 minutes later, Earhart said, \"We are circling but cannot hear you. Go ahead on 7,500.\" The Itasca immediatelysent As on 7,500 kilohertz. In the Electra, Earhartheard the stutter stop of As filling the cabin. The relief of finally hearing something must have been overwhelming. She quickly turned herradio direction finding loop to locate the null, but the signal never dropped out. The frequency was too high, so the radio waves fromthe Itasca were reflecting and arriving from different directions. Joseph Gurr, a radio mechanicwho worked on Earhart's plane, later said that they knewthere were limitations to high frequencies which had a tendency to skip and bend, creating a false radio direction bearing. Without a minimum, she was still lost. Earhart frantically called Itasca. \"We received your signalsbut unable to get a minimum. Please take a bearing onus and answer with voice.\" Itasca attempted to explain the problem. \"Your signals received okay. It is impractical to takea bearing on your voice.\" No response. Without the belly antenna, she probably never heardany of their communications. And it wouldn't have mattered if the Itasca had sentlow frequency signals because Earhart's loop was tunedto pick up 7,500 kilohertz. So, why didn't the Itasca correct the frequency she suggested? Commander Thompson of the Itasca was aware of her radiodirection finding limits. He had received messages both from Earhart'shusband, George Putnam, and the Coast Guard'sSan Francisco division stating Earhart could only take bearings on frequencies between200 and 1,500 kilohertz. But he either thought Earhart knew more about her radio equipment, or that it wasn't hisplace to make suggestions and take more responsibilityfor her flight. When she asked the Itasca to tell her if thesefrequencies weren't suitable, she could have been referringto the ship's capabilities rather than her own. The Itasca said they'd be ready on the frequencies she wanted and more instead of giving specific suggestions. San Francisco's Coast Guard division tried to get Commander Thompsonto take more responsibility for Earhart's radio communications by suggesting they directly tell Earhart which frequencies to use. But Thompson essentiallytold them to butt out. The Itasca communicated directlywith Earhart from then on. The radiomen continuedto try to reach Earhart, and just before 9:00 a.m., Earhart's voice suddenlyburst through again. \"We are on the line 157-337. We will repeat this on 6,210 kilohertz. We are running on line north and south.\" Her voice was desperate. It sounded as if she was about to burst into tears or scream. This was the lastmessage the Itasca heard. There are a number of conspiracy theories about what happened to Earhart after that, but the evidence seems clear. She ran out of fuelsomewhere over the Pacific and crashed into the sea. Two hours after her last message, the Itasca left Howland to search north and west for the Electra. Other Navy and CoastGuard ships and planes joined the search for over two weeks. To that point in US history, it was the most intensive and expensive search and rescue operation, costing around $4 million, which is almost 100million in today's money. No one has ever found atrace of Noonan, Earhart, or her Electra. All of these mistakescould have been resolved if Earhart had two-way communication, but her belly antennasomehow malfunctioned. Some theories suggest it fell off during takeoff in New Guinea, but without physical evidence, it's impossible to say. But Earhart did confirm receiving signals on her loop antenna. Her loop could only directionfind with lower frequencies, but it could receivesignals on a wide range. If she had switched to using the loop for all communications, she could have receivedItasca's voice messages and then the Itasca could have requested she take a bearing on a lower frequency, which would have guided hersafely to Howland Island. When I began researching this video, I expected to find that Amelia Earhart'sdemise was inevitable. That what she was tryingto do was just so difficult that nothing could have saved her. But instead, I found the opposite. There were at least a half dozen things that if they went differently would have allowed her to land safely. So to me, this storycomes down to two things. Knowledge and responsibility. Earhart lacked knowledge of radio systems, which would've allowed her to specify the right direction finding frequency. But Commander Thompson of theItasca had that knowledge. He knew her direction finding limits, but he didn't take on theresponsibility to correct her. When attempting any challenging endeavor, you need someone with the right knowledge who will also take responsibilityfor getting things right. That's what you need to battle the inherent chaosand disorder of the universe. Otherwise, what you get is disaster. This video was sponsored by KiwiCo, so I thought it would be appropriate to build theirradio-controlled delivery bot.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: natural selection fundamentally operates on genes, not just individuals or groups"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If you want to know if someone really understands evolution, just ask them this one weird question. Why does poop smell bad? Oh. Oh, gosh. Because it has bacteria in it, I guess? Microbiome, probably. Trash- Yeah, trash from the gut. ... of the body. The food we eat? Because of the chemicals? Farts don't always smell bad. Yeah. Well, that's a different question entirely. Do you think it objectively smells bad? Yes, I think so. Yes. How do you think it smells to flies? Like the fly? Yeah- They like it. They love it. They like it, yeah. They love it. Animals love stinky things. Yeah. They're attracted to it. Poop smells good to flies because poop is full of nutrients. They use it as food. But it's also full of bacteria that can be life-threatening to humans. So the real reason poop smells bad to us is because if anyone ever thought it smelled good, they would probably get really sick, die, and not pass on their genes. After all, it's about survival of the fittest. But survival of the fittest what? I mean, most people think of natural selection as being about the survival of the fittest individual animal. Individual. Individuals. Individual animal. Animal. Okay, so it's like an individual. Yeah. Which makes sense. I mean, individuals best adapted to their environment have increased odds of survival, and therefore a higher likelihood of passing on their genes. So it follows that each individual should do everything it can to survive and reproduce. That is, it should be selfish. But if that's true, then how do you explain this? Worker bees will sting predators to protect the hive, even though it might kill them in the process. Female worker ants are sterile, so they can't reproduce, but regardless, they work for the colony for their entire lives until they die. Monkeys adopt orphans, wolves bring meat to non-hunting members of the pack, and squirrels can let out alarm calls to warn others about nearby predators. So if natural selection is all about selfish individuals, why do we observe so much altruism in nature? The survival is of the species that can adapt. I think generally the species. For the survival of the species. So it's the survival of the species. Okay. Yeah, you're right. Okay. But survival of the fittest species or the fittest group also doesn't work. I mean, think about what you need for natural selection to occur. You need something that replicates itself many times over, creating copies, and then you need a pruning process, whereby some of those copies get eliminated and some thrive to go on and create more copies. The problem with groups or species is that they don\u2019t typically make copies of themselves. So you almost never get copies of groups fighting other copies of groups to see which groups win out. So if it's not survival of the fittest individual and it's not survival of the fittest group, then what is it? No text Well, to explain that, I want to take you on a little journey, all the way back to the beginnings of the Earth. Where we are now, there is nothing. Well, not really nothing, but nothing interesting. There are only simple things, like these blobs. This one might be a carbon dioxide molecule, or it might be cyanide. We don't know for sure what they are, but we do know that these compounds are very simple. So for now, they'll just be blobs floating around our void. In fact, much of what we'll encounter along our journey here are just hypotheses. A lot of Earth's early history is still a mystery, so keep that in mind. Now, every so often, our blobs get a surplus of energy, maybe from a ray of UV light or a nearby hot source. This is the first major upgrade to our void, excess energy, as it allows our blobs to interact with each other. And most of the time, this interaction leads to nothing, but sometimes these blobs can combine into more complicated compounds. Here's a simple simulated example, where we only have four red blobs. Right now, they are all individual particles, but each time step we move forward, let's say there's a 10% chance that all four combine into one red mega-blob. And now imagine this mega-blob isn't very stable. For every time step it's alive, it has a 95% chance of falling apart back into the four smaller blobs. If we add more of these red blobs into the mix, you'll notice that they rarely ever come together. On average, a mega-blob only exists around 10% of the time. But if we were to reduce the chances of the mega-blobs dissolving to only 1%, the void would suddenly be filled with them. This fact hints at an important law that governs our void, the law of stability. Unstable blobs fall apart and vanish. Stable ones endure. Now, watch what happens if we speed this up dramatically, maybe a couple of years per second, maybe even a couple million. You can see our blobs keep getting random jolts of energy, so they combine with others to form more complex compounds. Most attempts fail and fall apart, but every so often, by pure chance, you get a compound that is more stable than the blobs it's made of. This doesn't happen because the blobs want to build more complex structures. It's just because these new configurations happen to be more favorable in the environment. And now when these complicated compounds become abundant enough, they too get a chance to combine, making our void increasingly complex. And one day, by accident, this causes an extremely unique shape to form, one with a special property. See, the blobs it's made of just happen to attract similar blobs from the surrounding environment. This red blob always attracts green blobs, and this purple blob always attracts yellow ones, and piece by piece, all these blobs attract their opposites until their counterparts suddenly snap into position next to the original shape. Now, this shape goes on to do the same thing. Its green blobs attract red ones and yellow ones attract the purple until another shape yet again snaps into position. This new shape looks exactly like the original. What just happened fully spontaneously is replication. One shape became two. This marks the birth of the first replicator. We don't know exactly what this replicator looked like. It might've been a single standalone molecule or a group of molecules that worked together to replicate. There's a lot of debate on this today, so instead, let's represent the replicator as a character. How about this one here? Perfect. Keep in mind it's still just a lifeless molecule, one without any intent or purpose. Now, you might think that the chances for the replicator to form were extremely unlikely, but in our void, where we have hundreds of millions of years to play with, what might seem impossible to us becomes virtually inevitable. And the thing is, the replicator only has to arise once. Once it's here, it can take the simpler compounds available in the environment to copy itself at a much faster pace. And so it does that, until it entirely fills our void. No text At least, that's what you'd expect, but there is a flaw in the process. See, during the replicator's conquest of the void, one of its copies makes a mistake. Perhaps a stray ray of UV light hits it during the replication process, or the replicator uses a building block it wasn't supposed to. As a result, what we're left with is a new shape, which is slightly different from its parent, and so its properties might be slightly different too. This error might be harmful. For example, it might make the copy less stable. It could be beneficial, making the copy better at replicating, or it could be neutral, not changing the replicator in any meaningful way. This marks the final milestone in our void, mutation. Many species of replicators now occupy the void, No text and what they do is they replicate themselves. The problem is they all need the same limited resources, and so our void turns into a battleground. So which replicator will win? What kind of properties will the void favor? Well, let's try to simulate what happens. Now, if you\u2019re looking to run your own simulations, or need a place to run your own code look no further than today\u2019s sponsor \u2014 Hostinger.

Thanks to Hostinger for sponsoring this part of the video, and now back to our simulation. To simulate what a replicator battle might look like, let's assign simplified traits to each of the replicators, starting with the first one. This replicator is special, since it's the only one that can form spontaneously from smaller building blocks. So we'll give it a spawn rate. This should be quite rare, so let's set the chance of formation to 1% per time step. Just keep in mind we're just making these numbers up. The simulation is purely illustrative. Now, once the replicator spawns, let's say it's governed by three key traits. First, a death rate, the chance of it falling apart or being destroyed with each time step. Let's set that to be, say, 2%. Second, a replication rate, the chance to copy itself with each time step. Let's say 4%. And finally, a mutation rate, the chance a copy comes out mutated. If it's 4%, roughly one in 25 copies will be a mutation. So every time a new mutation spawns, it will inherit the replication death and mutation stats from its parent, but slightly randomized. Notice that we won't give any of these secondary replicators a spawn rate. They'll only be able to form as mutations from previous generations. So if all of their copies die out, they'll be gone for good. Now, before we run the simulation, I want to quickly shout out the YouTube channel Primer. Our setup was inspired by his amazing in-depth simulations on evolutionary biology. You should really check him out. Okay, let's run it. The graph on the right will show how the populations grow, and this box on the left will show a slice of the void, with all the winning replicators and the correct ratios. You can see how the first replicator appears and then immediately disappears, because it just happened to die before it got the chance to replicate. But that's okay. The original replicator can be created from smaller blobs, so it'll come back at some point. This time, it's starting to take off. You can also see that it spawns some mutations, but they're struggling to keep up. Eventually, though, superior mutations pop up and start to replicate faster than the original. But you can see almost all of them are growing exponentially, which is unrealistic. That's because we're missing the final piece of our simulation, limited resources. The building blocks should eventually run out. We can simulate this effect by introducing a sort of resource factor to each species' replication rate. This factor should depend on the total number of replicators in the void, N, which will also divide with an arbitrary crowding factor, C. C lets us define the maximum number of replicators we'll allow into the void. Say C is 10,000. Then once there are 10,000 replicators, the two terms cancel out and drive the replication rate down to zero, meaning none of the replicators will be able to make copies until the population drops again. So let's see how this changes our simulation. Okay. Like the last time, the original replicator starts to grow, after which it's quickly taken over by its mutations, but this time, most of these mutation populations start to decline. Because of the scarce resources, the new best population, the lime one, actually starts stealing resources from the others. After that, a few more mutations pop up, even more powerful than the lime. Ultimately, the purple replicator takes over, occupying around 9,000 of the 10,000 available spaces. It completely curbs all the other populations. It goes without saying that the environment plays a massive role in which replicator wins. If you change the environment, you likely change the outcome. But let's look at the stats of the replicator that came out on top this time. No text That winning species has a replication rate of 20%, compared to the 17% average across all populations. Obviously, being able to replicate quickly pays off here. Its death rate is below average. Replicators that fall apart less quickly can make more copies. And finally, it has a 1% mutation rate, compared to the average of 3.73%. Although mutations help by injecting diversity, for any single species, fewer mutations mean more faithful copies. If we rerun the simulation, you'll notice the outcomes are always slightly different, but the winning species consistently have high replication and low death and mutation rates. Now, in the real void, things wouldn't have been as simple. Instead of just tweaking these three stats, the replicators would have to mutate all sorts of different ways to gain an advantage. For example, one replicator might mutate a trait that lets it destroy other individuals and then use their building blocks to make more copies of itself. This looks like strategy, but it's really just chemistry that gets copied over and over because it helps the replicator survive. Naturally, a risk of offense would likely favor mutations that result in defense. So an opposing replicator might stumble upon a mutation that helps it form protective barriers from nearby materials, letting it endure those attacks. These barriers would also help protect the fragile replicators from environmental damage, like UV light. This marks an important threshold. The replicator's traits aren't limited to just determining the properties of the molecules themselves. They can also shape the environment. So by chance, the replicators inevitably mutate in ways that build scaffolding around themselves to increase the chances of their survival. They stumble upon ways of making structures to propel themselves around. They develop senses and ways of storing energy. They even mix, exchange, and steal traits from each other. Through billions of years of trial and error, this scaffolding gets more and more complex, and as a result, the replicator's interactions with the void become exceedingly indirect. They build complex survival machines for themselves, machines whose sole purpose is to protect the replicators inside. These machines became such experts at surviving, they're still around some 4 billion years later. They are the bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals all around you. Everything alive, including you, was built as a survival vessel for these replicators. But today, you'd barely recognize them as replicators. Now we just call them genes. They're hidden deep within every living creature, strands of DNA made from the sequences of A, T, G, and C nucleotides. Now, one of the leading theories is that those earliest replicators were actually something closer to RNA molecules, but then over time, this must have evolved into a more stable system of storing information, the DNA and proteins we use today. They are the code that shapes our traits. We\u2019re taught that these traits are here solely to help ensure our survival the survival of the individual or the species. But do we have this the wrong way around? No text When you have a child, what do you pass on? The DNA. The DNA, the genes. Yeah, the genes. Genes. Okay, yeah. These tiny replicators are still fighting the same battle that started billions of years ago, and the logic behind them hasn't changed. The traits just become more convoluted. Replicators that produce traits poorly suited to their environment tend to become less common, while those that produce advantageous traits become more numerous in the population. So it's not about the fittest individual or group, it's fundamentally about the survival of the fittest genes. They are the core unit of natural selection. But why would natural selection care exactly for the gene? Why not something smaller or something bigger? Well, for something to undergo selection, it needs to have three characteristics. First, it needs to be able to make near identical copies of itself. Second, it needs to exhibit traits that affect its interaction with the environment which, third, affect the probability of survival and reproduction of the replicator. Something small like a single nucleotide doesn't work, because, sure, it'll make identical copies of itself, but alone, it doesn't exhibit a trait that could be selected for. What about something bigger, like a chromosome? Well, each chromosome affects potentially thousands of traits that could influence its survival, but when most creatures reproduce, sections of chromosomes get swapped around. So a chromosome doesn't stay together as a cohesive replicating unit, and therefore it can't be selected for. But a gene is somewhere in the middle. It's a long enough stretch of DNA that it can independently influence a trait, but it's also short and stable enough to be faithfully copied over into future generations. This is why the gene is the unit of natural selection. This perspective led to one of the most powerful and controversial ways of seeing evolution, one popularized by Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene. Based on the work of evolutionary biologists in the 1960s and 1970s. And as a response against the, then very popular, group selection theory. Dawkins argued that just about every trait, from animals helping each other to being completely selfish, is a strategy that helps their genes survive and replicate. Genes that maximize their own survival are the genes that propagate best, even if they do so at the expense of others. Or in Dawkins' words, we are survival machines, robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. Now, you might think this framework isn't all that groundbreaking. I mean, take the emperor penguins in Antarctica for example. They hesitate to jump into the water until they are sure there are no seals around. So what kind of genes could help a penguin survive in this environment? Well, if the penguin\u2019s set of genes make it more likely to be timid, the penguin might stay back until someone braver tests the water. That way, the penguin is at a lower risk of being eaten, and has a better chance to survive, reproduce and pass on its \u2018timid\u2019 genes. Here, you can think about this either as \u2018the timid genes help the penguin\u2019 or \u2018the penguin helps the timid genes\u2019. Either way works. No text So is there any real benefit to viewing things from the gene's perspective? Well, look at what happens when you use these two frameworks to explain altruistic behavior, which appears in a lot of places in nature. Take California ground squirrels for example. Females will let out alarm calls if they spot a predator, like a fox or a hawk, to warn other nearby squirrels, even though this puts her survival at risk. The genes influencing this behavior surely don\u2019t help the squirrel. But can the squirrel still help the genes? I think this is a bit more clear if you think about the fact that most living things reproduce sexually. Right. So a squirrel will get half its DNA from its mom and half from its dad. So it's actually sharing half its genes with each parent. But also, any child that it has, it's also going to share half of its genes with the child, but also any siblings. But then if you take a step out to an uncle or up to a grandparent, then it's sharing one-quarter, and then another step out is one-eighth. All to say, you share a lot of genes with your immediate family. And California ground squirrels, females in particular, they live around family. So if a squirrel has a set of genes that make her call out when it spots a predator, there is a very good chance that the squirrels that hear her warning call also carry those genes. Now, as a result of her alarm call, let's say the squirrel attracts a predator her way, and it ends up getting eaten. This action cost the \u2018call\u2019 genes the chance to pass themselves on to any future offspring of that squirrel. But, if the warning call saved at least 2 copies of those genes in two of the squirrel\u2019s relatives\u2026 well then, in total, these 2 squirrels have a better chance of passing on the genes through their offspring than the single squirrel did. From the gene's perspective, this could be a good trade-off. It doesn\u2019t matter which individual helps the genes replicate, only that as many copies as possible survive. This principle, that altruistically helping your close relatives helps preserve your own genes, is known as kin selection. And the payoff behind any altruistic gesture under kin selection depends heavily on how related you are to the individuals you're helping, because the less related you are, the smaller the chances that you will share that particular gene with another individual. And you can see this in nature. Male squirrels that don't live near relatives almost never give out warning calls. Now, there is a big question this gene-centric view still has to address. No text If selection really favors genes that replicate well, then why would sex ever evolve as a means of replication, if it throws away roughly half the genes? Most animals reproduce sexually. So why do it, when some organisms, like certain plants and fungi, get to pass on all of their genes through asexual reproduction? From a gene's perspective, this seems like a much better deal. When it comes to sexual reproduction, people like to say, \"Okay. Well, it mixes up the genes. It's like shuffling a deck of cards, and isn't that better for creating more variation? And clearly, that's advantageous.\" Another way this has been explained is if the genes that regulate sexual reproduction benefit from replicating sexually, then they're going to keep pushing for these genes. Right. Even if it's a net negative to all the other genes in the genome. Yeah. So if it benefits them, they'll keep pushing for it. So are there any problems with how The Selfish Gene explains natural selection? Well, yes. I mean, it turns out the framework comes with a lot of controversy. One of the biggest criticisms against The Selfish Gene is that it leaves little to chance. It implies that every gene present in the genome is there because it actively got selected for, by natural selection, over many generations. But many genes are actually invisible to natural selection, because they don't really exhibit meaningful traits in the population. Yet, they can still evolve over time. Imagine 20 blind cave fish, 10 with green eyes and 10 with blue. Since they\u2019re blind, we\u2019ll assume that their eye color traits make no difference to their survival so they get passed down purely by chance. Now, to form the next generation, randomly \u201cpick\u201d any fish from the first group and replicate it. If you repeat this 20 times, you get a 2nd generation. By chance alone, one color will probably appear more often than the other. And if you repeat this process over many generations, one color might eventually completely take over. Not because it\u2019s better, but purely due to random sampling. This shift in the frequency of gene variants is called genetic drift. It\u2019s most apparent in small populations and for traits that aren't pruned for by natural selection. But it doesn\u2019t only apply to silent genes. Even when genes exhibit meaningful traits, there is a chance that genetic drift overrides natural selection, and a less fit gene will spread through the population just by chance. Look back at our replicator battle. If we run our simulation enough times, sometimes the winning gene won\u2019t be the one with the traits that maximize its own survival. Here, you can see that the winning population actually has a higher than average mutation rate, just by chance. And the average mutation rate is also higher than the starting value. These are simplified examples, but there is an ongoing argument about how much of evolution was actually due to natural selection and how much of it was up to chance. Another major criticism of The Selfish Gene is about the unavoidable implication behind the word selfish. It seems to imply that genes have agency, like they know what they're doing and they understand the consequences, but it's only a metaphor, just as portraying them as characters was a way for us to make the story more engaging. Of course, molecules don't know what they're doing. They don't decide to replicate or conspire to out-compete others. They just react according to the laws of physics. So what may look like intention is just simple chemistry that happens to work well and propagates. But perhaps the most obvious and easiest to understand criticism is No text that the whole framework is an oversimplification, and that's true. Genes are much more complicated than we thought. It's not as simple as one gene equals one trait. One gene can influence many traits, and one trait can be influenced by many genes. There are genes that are wholly contained within other genes. There are genes that inhibit or activate others, and then there are even genes that seem to not encode for anything, the so-called non-coding DNA. All to say, we still have a lot to learn about genes. Not to mention that the environment itself, like whether it's hot or cold, or how much food there is, also affects how different genes get expressed. Genes are much less deterministic than they might seem! So you might think that a single gene would rarely have a large enough effect that natural selection can directly impact it, but it doesn't matter how convoluted the pathway is. If a gene has a measurable effect on its own survival and replication, it will be subject to some amount of natural selection. And surely, the whole theory is a simplification, but any theory or framework of nature is. And what we're covering in this video is an even more simplified picture of that framework, but that doesn't take away the fact that viewing the world through this lens has an incredible power to help us understand the process of evolution. It helps us understand why we see such a range of different behaviors in our world because fundamentally, those traits tend to cause the increasing prevalence of the genes they are associated with. It's like the whole point is figure out what's true. Get to the truth. And this, to me, is the baseline truth of evolution. This is what I love about making Veritasium, is that we get to sort of unpack and dig under the hood. And it's what I loved about reading The Selfish Gene book, is that it really opened my eyes to this. Previously, I'd always just probably thought at the level of the individual, but it makes more sense to think at the level of the gene. The feeling that you and every other living organism is being driven by some molecules deep in every cell is fundamentally unsettling, and seems to remove agency from you as an acting, thinking being in the world. Yeah, it's pretty grim. But whether or not you agree with the fact that we might be controlled by our genes and we're simply their flesh robots, I think it's kind of unreasonable and unrealistic to go through life thinking that every decision is governed by this. It doesn't really do you any good, because we perceive the world as individuals. So I think it's very beneficial to see yourself as your own thing, as your own unit. I want to give a big shout-out to Joe Hanson from BeSmart for helping us out with this video, and another shout-out to Primer for letting us adapt his simulation on the first replicators. I have put links to their channels down in the description, so please check them out. And finally, I want to say a huge shout-out to you. Thank you for watching."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: normal distributions and power laws"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- Some things are not normal. By that I mean if you go out in the world and start measuring things like human height, IQ or the size of apples on a tree, you will find that for each of these things, most of the data clusters around some average value. This is so common that we call it the normal distribution, but some things in life are not like this - Nature shows power laws all over the place. That seems weird, like is nature tuning itself to criticality? - If you make a crude measure of how big is the world war by how many people it kills, you find that it follows a power law. The outcome will vary in size over 10 million, a hundred million. - It's a much more likelihood of really big events than you would expect from a normal distribution, and they will totally skew the average. - The system you're looking at doesn't have any inherent physical scale. It's really hard to know what's gonna happen next. - The more you measure, the bigger the average is, which is really weird. It sounds impossible. - It's, it's very important to try to understand, you know, which game you're playing and what are the payoffs going to be in the, in the long run. - In the late 1800s, Italian engineer Vilfredo Pareto, stumbled upon something no one had seen before. See, he suspected there might be a hidden pattern in how much money people make. So he gathered income tax records from Italy, England, France, and other European countries, and for each country he plotted the distribution of income. Each country he looked at, he saw the same pattern, a pattern which still holds in most countries to this day, and it's not a normal distribution. If you think about a normal distribution like height, there's a clearly defined average and extreme outliers basically never happen. I mean, you are never going to find someone who is say five times the average height. That would be physically impossible, but Pareto's income distributions were different. Take this curve for England, it shows the number of people who earn more than a certain income. The curve starts off declining steeply, most people earn relatively little, but then it falls away gradually much more slowly than a normal distribution would, and it spans several orders of magnitude. There were people who earned five times, 10 times, even a hundred times more than others. That kind of spread just wouldn't happen if income were normally distributed. Now to shrink this huge spread of data, Pareto calculated the logarithms of all the values and plotted those instead. In other words, he used a log log plot, and when he did that, the broad curve transformed into a straight line. The gradient was around negative 1.5. That means each time you double the income, say from 200 pounds to 400 pounds, the number of people earning at least that amount drops off by a factor of two to the power of 1.5, which is around 2.8. And this pattern holds for every doubling of income. So Pareto could describe the distribution of incomes with one simple equation. The number of people who earn an income greater than or equal to x is proportional to one over x to the power of 1.5. Now, that's what Pareto saw for England. But he performed the same analysis on data from Italy, France, Prussia, and a bunch of other countries, and he saw the same thing again and again. Each time the data transformed into a straight line and the gradients were remarkably similar. That meant Pareto could describe the income distribution in each country with the same equation, one over the income to some power where that power is just the absolute gradient of the logarithmic graph. This type of relationship is called a power law. When you move from the world of normal distributions to the world of power laws, things change dramatically. So to illustrate this, let's take a trip to the casino to play three different games. At table number one, you get 100 tosses of a coin. Each time you flip and it lands on heads, you win $1. So the question is, how much would you be prepared to pay to play this game? Well, we need to work out how much you'd expect to win in this game and then pay less than that expected value. So the probability of throwing ahead is one half, multiply that by $1 and multiply that by a hundred tosses. That gives you an expected payout of $50. So you should be willing to pay anything less than $50 to play this game. Sure, you might not win every time, No text but if you play the game hundreds of times, the small variations either side of the average will cancel out and you can expect to turn a profit. One of the first people to study this kind of problem was Abraham de Moivre in the early 1700s. He showed that if you plot the probability of each outcome, you get a bell-shaped curve, which was later coined the normal distribution, - Normal distributions. The traditional explanation is that when there are a lot of effects that are random that are adding up, that's when you expect normals. So like how tall I am depends on a lot of random things about my nutrition, about my parents', genetics, all kinds of things. But, but if they, if these random effects are additive, that is what tends to lead to normals. - At table number two, there's a slightly different game. You still get 100 tosses of the coin, but this time, instead of potentially winning a dollar on each flip, your winnings are multiplied by some factor. So you start out with $1 and then every time you toss a head, you multiply your winnings by 1.1. If instead the coin lands on tails, you multiply your winnings by 0.9 and after a hundred tosses, you take home the total that is the dollar. You started with times the string of 1.1s and 0.9s. So how much should you pay to play this game? Well, on each flip, your payout can either grow or shrink and each is equally likely each time you toss the coin. So the expected factor, each turn is just 1.1 plus 0.9 divided by two, which is one. So if you start out with $1, then your expected payout is just $1. That means you should be willing to pay anything less than a dollar to play this game. Right? Well, if you look at the distribution of payouts, you can see that you could win big. If you tossed a hundred heads, you'd win 1.1 to the power of a hundred. That's almost $14,000, although the chance of that happening is around 1 in 10 to the power of 30, you'd be more likely to win the lottery three times in a row. On the other hand, the median payout is around 61 cents. So if you're only playing the game one time and you want even odds of turning a profit, well then you should pay less than 61 cents. Though either way, if you played the game hundreds of times, your payout would average out to $1. Now watch what happens if we switch the x axis from a linear scale to a logarithmic scale. Well then you see the curve transforms into a normal distribution. That's why this type of distribution is called a log normal distribution. - When random effects multiply, if I have a certain wealth and then my wealth goes up by a certain percentage next year because of my investments, and then the year after that it, it changes by another random factor as opposed to adding, I'm multiplying year after year. If you have a big product of random numbers, when you take the log of a product, that's the sum of the logs. So if so, what was a product of random numbers then gets translated into sums of logs of random numbers, and that's what leads to this so-called log normal distribution and log normal distributions produce big inequalities. You don't just see a mean, you see a mean with a big long tail. It's much more likelihood of really big events in this case, tremendous wealth being obtained than you would expect from a normal distribution. - The reason this curve is so asymmetric is because the downside is capped at zero. So at most you could lose $1, but the upside can keep growing up to nearly $14,000. Now let's go on to table three. Again, you'll be tossing a coin, but this time you start out with a dollar and the payout doubles each time you toss the coin and you keep tossing until you get a heads. Then the game ends. So if you get heads on your first toss, you get $2. If you get a tails first and then get a heads on your second toss, you get $4. If you flipped two tails and then a head on your third toss, you'd get $8 and so on. If it took you to the Nth toss to get a heads, you would get 2 to the N dollars. So how much should you pay to play this game? Well, as in our previous example, we need to work out the expected value. So suppose you throw a head on your first try, the payout is $2 and the probability of that outcome is a half. So the expected value of that toss is a dollar. No text If it takes you two tosses to get a heads, then the payout is $4 and the probability of that happening is one over four. So again, the expected value is $1. We also need to add in the chance that you flip heads on your third try. In that case, the payout is $8 and the probability of that happening is one over eight. So again, the expected value is $1, and we have to keep repeating this calculation over all possible outcomes. We have to keep adding $1 for each of the different options for flipping the coin, say 10 times until it lands on heads or a hundred times before you get heads. I know it's extremely unlikely, but the payout is so huge that the expected value of that outcome is still a dollar. So it still increases the expected value of the whole game. This means that theoretically, the total expected value of this game is infinite. This is known as the St. Petersburg paradox. If you look at the distribution of payouts, you can see it's uncapped. It spans across all orders of magnitude. You could get a payout of a thousand dollars, a hundred thousand dollars, or even a million dollars or more. And while a million dollar payout is unlikely, it's not that unlikely. It's around one in a million. Now, if you transform both axes to a log scale, you see a straight line with a gradient of negative one. The payout of the St. Petersburg paradox follows a power law. The specific power law in this case is that the probability of a payout x is equal to x to the power of negative one or 1 over x. In the previous games, when you have a normal distribution or even a log normal distribution, you can measure the width of that distribution. It's standard deviation, and in a normal distribution, 95% of the data fall within two standard deviations from the mean. But with a power law, like in the St. Petersburg paradox, there is no measurable width. The standard deviation is infinite. This makes power laws a fundamentally different beast with some very weird properties. - Imagine you take a bunch of random samples and then average them and then take more random samples and average them. You'll find that the average keeps going up, it doesn't converge, and the more you measure, the bigger the average is, which is really weird. It sounds impossible, but it's because it has such a heavy tail, meaning the probability of really whopping big events is so significant that if you keep measuring occasionally, you're gonna measure one of those extreme outliers and they will totally skew the average. It's sort of like saying, you know, if you're standing in a room with Bill Gates or Elon Musk, the average wealth in that room you know is gonna be a hundred billion dollars or something because the average is dominated by one outlier. No text - And that same idea, one outlier can dominate the average shows up online too. A handful of companies, servers and data centers hold the personal information of millions of people.

So why do you get a power law from the simple St. Petersburg setup? If you look at the payout x, you can see it grows exponentially with each toss of the coin. x equals two to the N. But if you look at the probability of tossing the coin that many times to get a heads, you can see that this probability shrinks exponentially. So the probability of flipping a coin n times is a half to the power of n, but we're not really interested in the number of tosses. We're interested in the payout. Now we know that x equals two to the n. So instead of writing two to the n in our probability equation, we can just write x. So we end up with this. The probability of a payout of x dollars is equal to one over x, or in other words, x to the power of negative one. - You put them together, the exponentials conspire to make a power law. And that's a very common thing in nature, that a lot of times when we see power laws, there are two underlying exponentials that are dancing together to make a power law. - One example of this is earthquakes. If you look at data on earthquakes, you find that small earthquakes are very common, but earthquakes of increasing magnitudes become exponentially rarer. But the destruction that earthquakes cause is not proportional to their magnitude. It's proportional to the energy they release. And as earthquakes grow in magnitude, that energy grows exponentially. - So there's this exponential decay in frequency of earthquakes of a given magnitude and an exponential increase in the amount of energy released by earthquakes of a certain magnitude. So when you combine those two exponentials to eliminate the magnitude, what you find is a power law. - But power laws also reveal something deeper about the underlying structure of a system to see this in action. Let's go back to the third coin game in the St. Petersburg paradox. Now you can draw all the different outcomes as a tree diagram where the length of each branch is equal to its probability. So starting with a single line of length one and then a half for the first two branches, a quarter for the next four and so on. Now when you zoom in, you keep seeing the same structure repeating at smaller and smaller scales. It's self-similar like a fractal, and that's no coincidence. We see the same fractal-like pattern in the veins on a leaf river networks, the blood vessels in our lungs, even lightning. And in all of these cases, we can describe the pattern with a power law. No text Power laws and fractals are intrinsically linked. That's because power laws reveal something fundamental about a system structure. - So I've got a magnet and I've got a screw, and you'll notice if I bring them close together, then the screw gets attracted to the magnet, and that's because there's a lot of iron in it, which is ferromagnetic. But watch what happens if I start heating this up. Trying to, oh, you see that? Ah, there it went. There it went. You see, you heat it up and suddenly it becomes non-magnetic. To find out what happened, let's zoom in on this magnet. - Inside a magnet, each atom has its own magnetic moment, which means you can think of it like its own little magnet or compass. If one atom's moment points up, its neighbors tend to point that way too. Since this lowers the system's overall potential energy. Therefore at low temperatures, you get large regions called domains where all the moments align. And when many of these domains also align, their individual magnetic fields reinforce to create an overall field around the magnet. But if you heat up the magnet, each atom starts vibrating vigorously. The moments flip up and down, and so the alignment can break down. And when all the moments cancel out, then there's no longer a net magnetic field. Now, if you have the right equipment, you can balance any magnetic material right on that transition point, right between magnetic and non-magnetic. This is called the critical point, and it occurs at a specific temperature called the curie temperature. I asked Casper and the team to build a simulation to show what's going on inside the magnet at this critical point, - Each pixel represents the magnetic moment of an individual atom. Let's say red is up and blue is down. Now when the temperature is low, we get these big domains where the magnetic moments are all aligned and you get an overall magnetic field. But if we really crank up the temperature, then all of these moments start flipping up and down and so they cancel out and the magnet loses its magnetism. So that's exactly what happened in our demo. But if we tune the temperature just right, right to that Curie temperature, then the pattern becomes way more interesting. - This looks like a map, - Like a map? - Yeah, it almost looks like the Mediterranean or something. It's almost stable, like atoms that are pointing one way tend to point that way for a while, but there is clearly fluctuations as well. So domains are constantly coming and going. It's both got some elements of stability and some persistence over time. Some features which are consistent, but it's also not locked in place, right? Because you notice changes over time. - If you zoom in, you find that the same kinds of patterns repeat at all scales. You've got domains of tens of atoms, hundreds, thousands, even millions. There's just no inherent scale to the system that is, it's scale free. It's just like a fractal. And if you plot the size distribution of the domains, you get a power law. - The underlying geometry suddenly shows a fractal character that it doesn't have on either side of the phase transition. Right at the phase transition, you get fractal behavior and that pops out as a power law. - In fact, whenever you find a power law that indicates you're dealing with a system that has no intrinsic scale and that is a signature of a system in a critical state, which turns out has huge consequences. - See normally in a magnet below the Curie temperature, each atom influences only its neighbors. If one atom's magnetic moment flips up, then that means that its neighbors are slightly more likely to point up too. But that influence is local, it dies out just a few atoms away. But as the magnet approaches its critical temperature, those local influences start to chain together. One spin notches its neighbor and that neighbor notches the next and so on, like a rumor spreading through a crowd. And the result is that the effective range of influence keeps expending. And right at the critical point, No text it becomes effectively infinite. A flip on one side can cascade throughout the entire material. So you get these small causes, just a single flip to reverberate throughout the entire system. - And it gets right into that, that point where the system is maximally unstable, anything can happen. It's also maximally interesting, in a way it's, it means the system is most unpredictable, most uncertain. It's really hard to know what's gonna happen next. And that seems to be a a, a natural procedure that happens in many different systems in the world. - One such system is forest fires. In June, 1988, a lightning strike started a small fire near Yellowstone National Park. This was nothing outta the ordinary. Each year, Yellowstone experiences thousands of lightning strikes. Most don't cause fires, and those that do tend to burn a few trees, maybe even a few acres before they fizzle out. Three quarters of fires burn less than a quarter of an acre. The largest fire in the park's recent history occurred in 1931. That burned through 18,000 acres, an area slightly larger than Manhattan. But the 1988 fire was different. That initial spark spread slowly at first covering several thousand acres. Then over the next couple of months, it merged with other small fires to create an enormous complex of mega fires that blazed across 1.4 million acres of land that's around the size of the entire state of Delaware. That's 70 times bigger than the previous record, and 50 times the area of all the fires over the previous 15 years combined. So what was so special about the 1988 fires? Well, to find out, we made a forest fire simulator. - We've got a grid of squares, and on each square, either a tree could be there, it could grow, or it could not be there. There's gonna be some probability for lightning strikes. So you know, the higher that probability, the more fires we're gonna have. We can run this. - So trees are growing, trees are growing, forest is filling in, nice, getting pretty dense. - What do you expect is gonna happen? - I expect to see some fires probably, you know, now that, oh, that was good, that was a good little fire. Whoa, whoa, no way. Well, that's crazy. You haven't adjusted the parameters, right? It is just like, - Not yet. Not yet. - This seems like a very critical situation just by itself. I say that because of how big that fire was. - This sort of system will tune itself to criticality, and you can, you can see it start to happen. So right now, I think it's a good moment where you have basically domains of a lot of different sizes. And then one way to think about it is, if some of these domains become too big, then you get a single fire like that one perfectly timed, burns them out, it's just gonna propagate throughout the whole thing and burn it back down a little. But then if it goes too hard, then now you've got all these domains where there are no trees, and so it's gonna, you know, grow again to bring it back to that critical state. - I can see how it's the feedback mechanism, right, that the fire gets rid of all the trees and there's nothing left to burn, and then that has to fill in again. - Yeah - Yeah. But if there hasn't been a fire, then the forest gets too thick and then it's ripe for this sort of massive fire. - For a magnet. You have to painstakingly tune it to the critical point, but the forest naturally drives itself there. This phenomenon is called self-organized criticality. And if you let it run, what you get is again a power law distribution. So this is log log, so it should be a straight line. - That kind of stuff seems so totally random and unpredictable, and it is in one way, and yet it follows a pattern. There's a consistent mathematical pattern to all these kind of disasters. It's, it's shocking. - Is there something fractal about this? - Mostly in terms of the, I guess, domains of the trees when you're at that critical state. So you get very dense areas, you get non dense areas, and as a result, when a single lightning bolt strikes, you can get fires of all sizes. Most often you get small fires of 10 or fewer trees burning a little less frequently. You get fires of less than a hundred trees. And then every once in a while you get these massive fires that reverberate throughout the entire system. Now you might expect that because the fire is so large, there has to be a significant event causing it. But that's not the case because the cause for each fire is the exact same. No text It's a single lightning strike. The only difference is where it strikes and the exact makeup of the forest at that time. So in some very real way, the large fires are nothing more than magnified versions of the small ones. And even worse, they're inevitable. So what we've learned is that for systems in a critical state, there are no special events causing the massive fires. There was nothing special about the Yellowstone fire. - In 1935, the US Forest Service established the so-called 10:00 AM policy. The plan was to suppress every single fire by 10:00 AM on the day following its initial report. Now, naively, this strategy makes sense. I mean, if you keep all fires under strict control, then none can ever get out of hand. But it turns out this strategy is extremely risky. - So let's say we're gonna bring down the lightning probability, so it's very small, only one in a million right now. And we're also gonna crank up, you know, the tree growth a little bit. Now, what do you think is gonna happen? - We're gonna get some big fires I would imagine, like a lot of not fire and then some huge fires. Yeah. - Yep. - Oh boy. So nowadays the fire service has a very different approach. They acknowledge that some fires are essential to make the mega fires less likely. So they let most small fires burn and only intervene when necessary. In some cases, they even intentionally create small fires to burn through some of the buildup. Though it could take years to return the forest to its natural state after a century of fire suppression. But it's more than just the Earth's forests that are balanced in this critical state. Every day the Earth's crust is moving and rearranging itself. Stresses build up slowly as tectonic plates rub against each other. Most of the time you get a few rocks crumbling, the ground might move just a fraction of a millimeter, but the stresses dissipate in many earthquakes that you wouldn't even feel. - There are really tiny earthquakes that are happening right now between be beneath your feet, you just can't feel 'em. 'cause they're very small, but they are earthquakes. They're driven by small slipping movements in the Earth's crust. - But sometimes those random movements can trigger a powerful chain reaction. - In Kobe Japan, the morning of January 17th, 1995 seemed just like any other, this was a peaceful city. And although Japan as a country is no stranger to earthquakes, Kobe hadn't suffered a major No text quake for centuries. Generations grew up believing the ground beneath them was stable. But that morning, deep underground, a stress released nearby the Nojima fault line. The stress propagated to the next section of the fault. And the next, within seconds, the ruptured cascaded along 40 kilometers of crust, shifting the ground by up to two meters and releasing the energy equivalent of numerous atomic bombs. The resulting quake destroyed thousands of homes along with most major roads and railways leading into the city. It killed over 6,000 people and forced 300,000 from their homes. - How far it goes depends a lot on chance and the organization of all that stress field in the Earth's crust. And it just seems to be organized in such a way that it is possible oftentimes for the earthquake to trickle along an avalanche along a long way and produce a very large unusual earthquake. But if you look at the process behind that earthquake, it is exactly the same physical process. It's just that the earthquake generating process naturally produces events that range over an enormous range of scale. And we're not really used to thinking about that. - We have this ingrained assumption that we can use the past to predict the future, but when it comes to earthquakes or any system that's in a critical state, that assumption can be catastrophic because they're famously unpredictable. So how can you even begin to model something like the behavior of earthquakes? - In 1987, Danish physicist Per Bak and his colleagues considered a simple thought experiment, take a grain of sand and drop it on a grid, then keep dropping grains on top until at some point the sand pile gets so steep that the grains tumble down onto different squares. - What they looked at was the size of these, what they were calling avalanches, these reorganizations of numbers of grains of sand. They asked for how often do you see avalanches of a certain size? - This is the most simple version of a sand pile simulator that you could almost imagine. We're gonna drop a little grain of sand, at first always in the center, and then it's just gonna keep going up for one grain, it'll be fine for two grains, it'll be fine, three grains, it'll be fine, but it's on the edge of toppling. And then when it reaches four or more, it's gonna basically go, it feels a bit like a, I don't know, pulsing thing, like something's trying to escape or something very video game-like that seemed pretty crazy and it is symmetrical. - Yeah, nice geometric features. - So this might be interesting because right now we paused it at a point where this middle one is gonna go and then you look around it and you see essentially you can think of these brown or you know, these three tall grain stacks as being maximally unstable. They're about to go. And so you could think of them as these fingers of instability, if anything touches them. The whole system, like they're, they're just gonna go, - I see it propagating out, - It's cool seeing it slower. I feel like you can see several waves propagating at the same time. - Some people have reasoned that the earth's crust becomes riddled with similar fingers of instability where you get stresses building up and then when one rock crumbles, it can propagate along these fingers potentially triggering massive earthquakes. If you look at the data, there's some even more compelling evidence that links the sand pile simulation to earthquakes. - Let's say instead of dropping it at the center, pretty unrealistic to have a drop in the center. I'm gonna drop at random. - Huh. That is crazy. You can actually see it tune itself to the critical state. Like at the start, you only see these super tiny avalanches. - Yeah. - And then now it's everything. - It has to build up. - We can slow down a little. Oh, and that's a super clean power law. There are events of all sizes. One grain of sand might knock over just a few others, or it could trigger an avalanche of millions of grains that cascade throughout the entire system. And if you look at the power law you get from the sand pile simulation, it closely resembles the power law of the energy released by real earthquakes. But if you look at the sand pile experiment more closely, it doesn't just resemble earthquakes. What does it remind you of? - Forest fires. - Right?! Feels like it's the exact same behavior. - That's the really surprising thing. And that's why this little paper with a sand pile was published in the world's top journal because it did something that people just didn't really think was was possible. - Now, what's ironic is if you look at real sand piles, they don't behave like this. - Okay, you said sand, I'm gonna do an experiment on a real sand pile. And of course it doesn't follow a power law distribution of avalanches at all. It's totally wrong. Per Bak naturally gets a chance to reply to the criticism. And he says, I'm pretty close to quoting. He says, self-organized criticality only applies to the systems it applies to. So he doesn't care the, the fact that his theory is not relevant to real sand piles. So what? Get out of my face. He's interested in bigger fish to fry than, than, you know, sand piles. It's like you're taking me too, literally. No text I'm talking about a universal mechanism for generating power laws. And the fact that it doesn't depend, it doesn't work in real sand is uninteresting to him. I thought that took some real nerve. - You could think about the earth and the earth going around the sun. That's a very complex system. You've got all the, you've got the molten core, everything sloshing around, and you've got oceans and you've even got the moon going around the earth, which in theory, you know, all should affect the exact motion of the earth around the sun. But Newton ignored all of that. All he looked at was just a single parameter, essentially the mass of the earth. And with that, he could correctly, for the most part, predict how the earth was gonna go around the sun. Similarly here, there are people that have looked at these phenomena that go to the critical state in this, in this case it's self-organized criticality as it brings itself there. And what they find is that there's this universal behavior where it doesn't even really matter what the sub parts are, you just get the behavior that's the exact same - At that critical point when, when all the forces are poised and the system is right on that delicate balance between being organized, highly organized, or being totally disorganized, it turns out that almost none of the physical details about that system matter to how it behaves. There's just a universal behavior that is irrespective of what physical system you're talking about. The term that was used is called universality. And it's kind of a miracle. It means you can make extremely powerful theories without involving any technical details, any real details of the material. - What this means is that you could have these systems that on the surface seem totally different, but when you get to the critical point, they all behave in the exact same way. The other thing you could do is instead of this being trees, you could imagine it being people. And the thing that's spreading... - Is disease. - Is disease, yeah. - You almost get something for nothing at these, at these critical points. - See, many of these systems fall into what's known as universality classes. Some of them you need to tune to get there like magnets at their Curie temperature or fluids like water or carbon dioxide at their critical points. But some other systems seem to organize themselves to criticality like the forest fires or sand piles or earthquakes. But what's crazy is that if you succeed in understanding just one system from a class, then you know how all the systems in that class behave. And that includes even the crudest simplest toy models like the simulations we've looked at. So you can model incredibly complex systems with the most basic of models. And some people think this critical thinking applies even further. When we look around the world, there are lots of systems that show the same power law behavior that we see in this critical systems. It's in everything from DNA sequencing to the distribution of species in an ecosystem to the size of mass extinctions throughout history. We even see the same behavior in human systems like the populations of cities fluctuations in stock prices, citations of scientific papers, and even the number of deaths in wars. So some people argue that these systems and perhaps many parts of our world also organize themselves to this critical point. - So the fact that all these natural hazards, as they call them, floods, wildfires, and earthquakes, they all follow power law distributions means that these extreme events are much more common than you would think based on normal distribution thinking. - If you find yourself in a situation or an environment that is sort of governed by a power law, how how should you change her behavior? - If you have events with one of these power distributions, what you're seeing most of the time is small events. And this can lull you into a false sense of security. You think you understand how things are going. You know, floods for example, there are a lot of small floods, and then every once in a while there's a huge one. One response to this is insurance. That insurance is designed precisely to protect you against the large rare events that would otherwise be very bad. But then there's the other side of that picture, which is you are the insurance company that needs to insure people and they have a particularly difficult job No text because they have to be able to say how much to charge so that they have enough money to pay out when the big bad thing comes along. - In 2018, a forest fire tore through Paradise California. It became the deadliest and most destructive fire in the state's history. But the insurance company, Merced Property and Casualty hadn't planned for something that huge and when the claims came in, they just didn't have the reserves to pay out. So just like that, the company went bust. - But while extreme events can cripple some companies, there are entire industries that are built on power law distributions. Between 1985 and 2014, private equity firm, Horsley Bridge invested in 7,000 different startups and over half of their investments actually lost money. But the top 6% more than 10x in value and generated 60% of the firm's overall profit. In fact, the best venture capital firms often have more investments that lose money. They just have a few crazy outliers that show extraordinary growth. A few outliers that carry the entire performance. In 2012, Y Combinator calculated at 75% of their returns came from just two out of the 280 startups they invested in. So venture capital is a world that depends on taking risks in the hope that you'll get a few of these extreme outliers which outperform all of the rest of the investments combined. - Book publishers operate in a similar fashion, most titles flop, but in 1997, a small independent UK publisher called Bloomsbury took a chance on a story about a boy wizard. The boy's name of course was Harry Potter. And now Bloomsbury is a globally recognized brand. We see a similar pattern play out on streaming platforms. On Netflix, the top 6% of shows account for over half of all viewing hours on the platform. On YouTube, less than 4% of videos ever reach 10,000 views, but those videos account for over 93% of all views. - All these domains follow the same principle that Pareto identified over 100 years ago, where the majority of the wealth goes to the richest few. The entire game is defined by the rare runaway hits. - But not every industry can play this game. Like if you're running a restaurant, you need to fill tables night after night. You can't have one particularly busy summer evening that brings in millions of customers to make up for a bunch of quiet nights. Over a year the busy nights and quiet ones balance out and you're left with the average. Airlines are similar, an airline needs to fill seats on each flight. You can't squeeze a million passengers onto one plane. So it's the average number of passengers over the year that defines an airline success. - We're used to living in this world of normal distributions. And you act a certain way. - Yeah - But as soon as you switch to this realm that is governed by a power law, you need to start acting vastly different. It really pays to know what kind of world you're or what kind of game you're playing. - That is good. That's good. Yes. No text You should come on camera and just say that just like that. You were on camera, you just did do it. - If you are in a world where random additive variations can slow out over time, then you get a normal distribution. And in this case, it's the average performance. So consistency, which is important. But if you are in a world that's governed by a power law where your returns can multiply and they can grow over many orders of magnitude, then it might make sense to take some riskier bets in the hope that one of them pays off huge. In other words, it becomes more important to be persistent than consistent. - Though as we saw in the second coin game, totally random multiplicative returns give you a logged normal distribution, not a power law. To get a power law, there must be some other mechanism at play. In the early two thousands, Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si was studying the internet, and to his surprise, he found that there was no normal webpage with some average number of links. Instead, the distribution followed a power law. A few sites like Yahoo had thousands of times more connections than most of the others. Barab\u00e1si wondered what could be causing this power law of the internet. So he made a simple prediction. As new sites were added to the internet, they were more likely to link to well-known pages. To test this prediction, he and his colleague R\u00e9ka Albert ran a simulation. They started with a network of just a few nodes, and gradually they added new nodes to the network with each new node more likely to connect to those with the most links. As the network grew, a power law emerged. The power was around negative two, which almost exactly matched the real data of the internet. - Look at that. It's still so satisfying. - That's fun. This will basically also distribute a power law. One of the ideas here is that, you know, this could be individuals or even companies. And so if you're more likely to become more successful or more well known to, well more known or successful, you already are, you're gonna get this sort of runaway effect where you're, you get a few that sort of dominate, you know, the distributions. I wonder if part of the takeaway is like if you're playing some sort of game that is dominated by power law, then you better do the work as much of it as early as possible. So you get to benefit from the snowball effect, essentially. - Yeah, I guess. I guess that's, that's a good idea. I'm not sure whether you can control it though. Human beings like to think of ourselves as being a bit special and that maybe somehow because we're intelligent and have free will, we will escape the provenance of the laws of of physics in order and organization. But I think that's probably not not the case. So if you look at, at the number of world wars, and if you make a crude measure of how big is the world war by how many people it kills, which is a bit macabre, but still you find that, again, it follows a power law virtually identical to the power law you find in stock market crashes. - So if the world is shaped by power laws, then it feels like we're poised in this kind of critical state where two identical grains of sand, two identical actions can have wildly different effects. Most things barely move the needle, but a few rare events totally dwarf the rest. And that I think is the most important lesson. If you choose to pursue areas governed by the normal distribution, you can pretty much guarantee average results. But if you select pursuits ruled by power laws, the goal isn't to avoid risk, it's to make repeated intelligent bets. Most of them will fail, but you only need one wild success to pay for all the rest. - And the thing is that beforehand you cannot know which bed it's going to be because the system is maximally unpredictable. It could be that your next bet does nothing. It could do a little bit or it could change your entire life. In fact, around three years ago, I was reading this little book, and in the book there was this little line saying something like one idea could transform your entire life. So right underneath that, I wrote, send an email to Veritasium. A couple days later, I wrote an email to Derek saying, Hey Derek, I'm Casper. I study physics and I can help you research videos. I didn't hear back for four weeks, so I was getting pretty sad and just wanted to forget about it and move on. But then a couple days later I got an email back saying, Hey Casper, we can't do an internship right now, but how would you like to research, write and produce a video as a freelancer? So I did, and that's how I got started at Veritasium. Hey, just a few quick final things. All the simulations that we used in this video we'll make available for free for you to use in the link in the description. And the other thing is that we just launched the official Veritasium game. It's called Elements of Truth, and it's a tabletop game with over 800 questions. It's the perfect way to challenge your friends and see who comes out on top. Now at Veritasium, we're all quite competitive, so every time we play things get a little bit heated, but that's honestly a big part of the fun. Now, when we launched on Kickstarter, we got a lot of questions asking if we could ship to specific countries. And originally we didn't enable this, and this is our mistake. This is on us and we totally hear you. But I'm glad to say that right now we have enabled worldwide shipping. So no matter where you are in the world, you can get your very own copy. To reserve your copy and get involved. Scan this QR code or click the link in the description. I wanna thank you for all your support and most of all, thank you for watching."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: the evolution and perception of color vision in jumping spiders"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your brain might think you'relooking at a yellow ball, but look closer. The screen you're watching thison displays color using only red, green, and blue subpixels. The yellow your brain thinksit's seeing is actually a mix of red and green light. The camera I'm talking toright now has a sensor composed of red, green, andblue-sensitive photosites. Again, no yellow. Of course, I have theball here in my hand, so I am looking at a yellow ball, or am I? (light mysterious music) After all my eyes aren't sodifferent from that camera. The human retina only hascone cells sensitive to red, green, or blue wavelengths of light. To perceive other colors, wehave to integrate the inputs from those three cone types. When yellow light enters myeye, it stimulates my red and green-sensitive cone cells, although not as much as purered, or green light would. With red and green-sensitivecones equally excited, my brain tells me I'm looking at yellow. This is how our technology, our cameras, and screens, and projectorscan trick our brains into seeing a whole rainbow of colors using just three wavelengths of light by triggering our threedifferent types of cone cells in different proportions. So is the ball really yellow? What does yellow even mean? A lot of people would say that color is the wavelengths of lightthat an object reflects. In other words, like Aristotle thought, color is a property of the object. But looking at the same ball on a screen, your eyes only sensed red and green light, yet your brain stillperceived it as yellow. So it's also possible,like Galileo believed, that color isn't a propertyof an object at all, but a phenomenon of the mind instead. But whose mind? Because we aren't the only animals that can see the world in color. We oftentimes don't really think about how other animals see color. So for example, we buyour dogs bright red, or orange toys that are onlybright red, or orange for us, and not for them, becausethey can't see orange, or red as being distinct from green. [Derek] So maybe we shouldstart taking in the world from more than just the human perspective. Doing that might justteach us why color vision evolved in the first place. We're actually towards the lower end of the spectrum, honestly. We're a step up from ourhousehold pets, maybe, if they're cats, or dogs, but not nearly as good asmany animal groups out there, butterflies, birds, fish,lizards, jumping spiders. Jumping spiders are harmlesscreatures, actually. They don't ever reallyget big enough to pose much of a threat to humans. Of course, if you were a small insect, yes, you would absolutelyneed to be afraid of a jumping spider. [Lisa] They'll takedown prey that's sometimes like two, or three timestheir own body size. The Chinese word for jumpingspider translates literally to fly tiger, and that's theway I like to think about them is the kind of smallcats of the undergrowth. Jumping spiders are everywhere. They're in your backyard. They're probably in your kitchen. There are about 6,000 speciesof jumping spiders known. Some are sort of furry,some are sort of shiny, striped, spotted, red, green, blue. Pretty much anything you can imagine. It's like every one isa little work of art. As a group, spiders aren'tknown for their vision. I mean, most species are nocturnal, and for many, their webs actas a sort of extra sense organ, so they just don't need to see that well. But jumping spiders, asactive daytime hunters, well, they're different. Not only do they have great eyesight, but different species havedifferent forms of color vision. Look at those eyes. Jumping spider eyes are fascinating, and when I say eyes, I mean eight eyes. Jumping spiders split upthings like motion detection and light sensitivity to some eyes, and then color vision and finedetail vision into others. The pair of eyes that areperhaps the most fascinating, or most unusual are whatwe call the principal eyes, and those are the really bigeyes in the front of the face that make jumping spiderslook a little cute if you're willing to saya spider looks cute ever, and those are built unlike any other eye in the animal kingdom. [Derek] It turns out the way jumping spiders perceivecolor has everything to do with the anatomy of those principal eyes. [Nathan] They're really actually built a lot like a Galileantelescope, or binoculars. That big lens that you see fromthe outside of the animal is one of two lenses in these eyes, and in between those two lenses is a long fluid-filled tube. At the end of that fluid-filledtube is a second lens, and what that lens does isit magnifies the image that that first lens projectsdown that long tube, and in that way, it increasesthe ability to see detail by the retina that sits right below it. [Derek] And when itcomes to seeing detail, it's hard to beat a jumping spider. For most animals, the bigger the eye, the better it functions. Jumping spiders absolutelybreak this rule. The secondary eyes can see the world about as well as the absolutebest insect eyes out there, better than the world'sbiggest dragonflies, whose entire head is consumed by an eye. The principal eyes, they can actually see pattern in the world better than a lap dog, a house cat, an elephant, and nearly as good asthe sharp-sighted pigeon, but it's a very narrow sliceof the world that they can see. It's about like your thumbheld at arm's length. [Derek] And it's only inthat narrow slice of the world that jumping spiders cansee fine detail and color. So the jumping spider'ssecondary eyes give them a full 360-degree view of the world. Now, imagine most ofthat's in black and white. When you see something move,you can swivel to look at it. And now, anything that'sreally of curiosity to you, you can add to this worldof black and white vision fine detail and color. But you can only do it moment by moment. So you're really kind ofpainting additional details about color and pattern thatyou couldn't see otherwise. It's a wild world to tryto put yourself into. (bee buzzing) As they sweep theirprincipal eyes across a scene, some species of jumping spiders are adding a lot more color informationto their world than others. Most jumping spiders, includingthis one, are dichromats, meaning they have two typesof color-sensitive cone cells in their retinas, just likedogs and most other mammals. [Nathan] And by comparingthose two kinds of cells and how they respond tolight in the environment, they get a coarse understanding of color. They can tell the difference between UV, violet, blue, and green. But some types of jumpingspiders are trichromats with three types of cones, like humans, and other are tetrachromats, like birds. (light music) The weird thing is all these species with expanded color vision aren't necessarily close relatives. In jumping spiders,we have huge variation, even from closely related groups, in how well they're ableto see color in the world. Jumping spiders arereinventing, in some ways, the ability to see colorover and over again in different ways. That makes jumpingspiders pretty special. I mean, consider primates. Old World monkeys, apes, and humans all havetrichromatic color vision, but we also share a common ancestor. So our color visionprobably evolved only once, and then it stuck around. This is where jumpingspiders really stand out. The ability to see red, for example, has evolved severaltimes in jumping spiders. Researchers know that, because they've figured out how different groups are related, and by they, I mostly mean jumping spider fanatic Wayne Maddison. Oh my gosh, Havaika. Fantastic! Beautiful male. Ah, it's been, it's been30 years since I've seen a live Havaika. [Megan] He is absolutelyMr. Jumping Spider. His expertise really is injumping spider taxonomy. I work on the evolutionarytree of jumping spiders. The evolutionary tree of life is basically the pathway of geneticdescent that links all of us. [Derek] The positionof different species on this evolutionary treecan tell us how they ended up with the traits they have. Like if most jumpingspiders don't see red, but two species on two verydifferent parts of the tree do, chances are that those two species evolved those abilities independently. In which case, then we canstart to ask questions like what's driving that evolution? Do they have similar ecologies? Do they hunt similar prey? And try to really understand what selective forces are leading to these expanded color vision systems. It might help them find food, or discriminate tasty preyfrom prey that can harm them. [Nathan] Because, of course, lots of small insectsare brightly colored, and some of them areusing those bright colors to advertise that they're toxic. [Derek] Anotherpossibility is that seeing a richer world of colormight help animals, from lizards to spiders,choose better mates. To test these ideas, theresearchers needed to know which of the 6,000 speciesof jumping spiders had expanded color vision and which didn't, and outside of a few well-studied species, no one really knew. So the team set out to collect spiders from every major branch of thejumping spider family tree. One of our first things isjust prioritizing where to go and what to look for. And so, it's a lot ofsampling in a lot of places. Let's see who lives here. [Derek] It's kind of like \"Pokemon GO,\" except the Pokemon are real, they're smaller thanyour pinky fingernail, and they're really good at hiding. Some jumping spiders have evolved to be really fine-tunedto a particular situation. So for example, there are termite-eatingspecialist jumping spiders that you're only gonnafind around termites. There was this onespecies that we only found in piles of bones in South Africa. Who knows what it was doing there, but we quickly learned that that was the only place in the environment we were gonna find it. And so, that's part of the fun of it. I feel like it's a bit ofa treasure hunt, really. (light music) With no proverbial stone left unturned, the team returns to theirlabs with hundreds of spiders representing many different species. They want to figure out which species have expanded color vision, howeach species does it, and why. It's actually a hard question to tell how animals can see color. We can't just connect ourbrains to see what they see. So how do we do it? [Nathan] We begin by using a technique called microspectrophotometry. It's a really long word. What it simply means is amicroscope paired with a device that measures differentwavelengths of light, a spectrophotometer. [Derek] The researcherstake ultra-thin slices of jumping spider retinas, and then they measure thewavelengths of light absorbed by individual cone cells. With enough of these measurements, they can tell if a species is a dichromat, trichromat, or tetrachromat, and what wavelengths of light its cells are best at detecting. But that's not the whole story. Having that knowledge ofwhat's in the retina tells us what is, or isn't possiblefor these animals to see, but it doesn't actuallytell us what they do see, or how they might use that. And so, the gold standard for establishing that an animal can see coloris to do so behaviorally. In other words, we somehowneed to ask the spiders what they can see and thenunderstand their answers. Figuring out what's going on inside a spider's mind is difficult. It's no surprise that it takes a group of expert zoologists to do so. But our own minds canbe just as complicated, yet we rarely talk withmental health experts to help us interpret ourthoughts and emotions. Whether you're feeling depressed, anxious, or are just stressed andwant someone to talk to, a therapist lets you see things from a different perspective, and that's where today'ssponsor, BetterHelp, comes in.

Clicking that link bothhelps support this channel, but it also gets you 10%off your first month. So I wanna thank BetterHelpfor sponsoring this video, and now, back to jumpingspiders and how they see color. These animals are particularly motivated to investigate things that move, and these responsescan be guided by color. [Derek] The theory is simple. You show the spider ascreen with a moving shape that differs from the background in color, but not in brightness, and you see if the spider tries to follow. [Nathan] The problem withletting the jumping spider actually turn and respond isthat they'll absolutely do so, but it changes some of what they see. So what we want is toreally have some control over what the spiders cansee at any given moment. So the researchers hold them in place with tiny magnets attached to their heads. [Nathan] What we do is wegive them a ball to stand on. They actually hold it with their feet, and we can monitor how thatball moves around in their feet to know where they would want to go. If the spider turnsthe ball to the left, it's probably trying to look to the right to follow the moving shape, and that's evidence thespider can discriminate between the colors of theshape and the background. (playful music) Once the team knows whichspecies can see which colors, the next question is how do they do it? What's different in the DNAof these spiders that can see and discriminate more colors? If you ask Megan Porter, alot of it comes down to genes that encode proteins called opsins. The way that animalsachieve color vision is to have different copiesof this opsin gene, and those variations thenare what produce proteins that are sensitive todifferent colors of light. The first techniquethat we generally go to with a new species is calledtranscriptome sequencing, and this is where wecan take the entire head of a jumping spider, andwe can get the sequences for every single gene thatis expressed in that tissue. [Derek] This method givesthe researchers an inventory of all the genes being expressed, in other words, all the genesthat are copied out of the DNA and sent to make a protein. Then the team can figure out where each of these genes is expressed, in which eyes, and inwhich parts of the eye. And we do that using a fancy technique calledimmunohistochemistry. [Derek] The researchers basically create glowing molecular tagsspecific to each protein they're interested in. [Megan] And then lookingfor which parts glow in the right color, we can figure out where each opsin is being expressed, where the protein is located. The team is especiallyinterested in genes that are expressed in theretinas of the principal eyes. These are the genes mostlikely to be related to changes in color vision. Already, this process of asking which species have expanded color vision and how they accomplish it has led to some surprising discoveries. The researchers alreadyknew that the ability to see and discriminate more colorshad evolved more than once among jumping spiders. But they hadn't realized just how widespread this ability would be. After measuring 45 speciesacross the evolutionary tree, the team has already found as many as 12 independentchanges in color vision. In evolutionary terms, jumpingspiders seem to be evolving new expanded forms ofcolor vision all the time, and different species have acquired their new visual capabilitiesin very different ways. Take, for example, the ability to see red. Most jumping spidersonly have green-sensitive and UV-sensitive photopigments in their retinas. But some species became sensitive to red when their green-sensitive opsin gene was accidentally duplicated in the genome, and the new copy started to evolve, shifting its sensitivityto longer wavelengths. So in our eyes, that'sexactly what happened. The opsin gene for ourgreen-sensitive visual pigment was duplicated, and thesecond version evolved to be more red-sensitive, and we see this happen overand over and over again in jumping spiders. But other jumping spiders see red in a totally different way. Rather than evolving new photo pigments, they added an internal filter to some of theirgreen-sensitive cone cells, which cuts out green light, and forces those cells to respond only to longer wavelengths, like red. They can basicallycreate two kinds of cells from the same type of photoreceptor simply by using a filterin front of some of them and not in front of others. All this evolutionary innovation makes the original questioneven more intriguing. Why evolve expanded colorvision in the first place? That's the question LisaTaylor is trying to answer. For a visual predator,like a jumping spider, better color vision couldmean finding more prey. It could also mean avoidingprey that might harmful. [Lisa] And so, a lot of preyin the environment advertise their toxicity with bright colors, and particularly withlong wavelength colors, such as red and orange. So we're testing the idea that the ability to use color vision will helpthese spiders learn to avoid and continue to avoidred prey that taste bad. [Derek] In this experiment,all the prey are termites. Some have a dab of redpaint on their backs, and others have a dab of gray, And this doesn't affecttheir behavior in any way. They still move around naturally, and the spiders reallylike to eat termites. [Derek] The redtermites also get treated with a compound called Bitrex, which is actually the mostbitter substance known. And yeah, it turns outthat the spiders also think it tastes disgusting. So we can simultaneously and independently manipulatecolor and palatability. In other words, the researchers can make the termites red andbitter, gray and tasty, or if they want to mess with the spiders, gray and bitter, or red and tasty. The first part of the experimentis the training phase. Basically, the spiders getto choose from a tiny buffet of termite prey, each one inits own little Petri dish. [Lisa] In three of the Petri dishes, they get a red-painted,bitter-tasting termite, and then the other three Petri dishes, they get a gray-painted,very tasty termite. As they interact with this prey, they are constantly learning and it's constantly being reinforced that whenever they attack something red, they get a mouthful ofbitter-tasting termite, and whenever they attack something gray, they get a mouthful of tasty termite. The first spiders to gothrough this experiment are Habronattus pyrrithrix,and we started with them because we know that theyhave good color vision that extends into the long wavelengths. [Derek] Habronattuspyrrithrix is one of the species that can see red using a red filter in front of some of itsgreen-sensitive cone cells. [Lisa] Our data so far suggests that the spiders are reallygood at learning the rules. And once they learn the rules, then the real experiment begins. The spiders hunt for alltheir food in a setup just like the termite buffetwhere they were trained, except that for half of the spiders there's a big difference. Some of the termites are stillbitter, but they're all gray. The color cues are gone. Now, the question becomes do the spiders that havecolor cues available, in other words, the onesfor which bitter termites are still red, do they do better? So our data so far showthat they do fare better when they have access to those color cues, they lay eggs sooner, and that they're also heavierat the end of the experiment if they're in the treatment group where they have access to color cues. One hypothesis for why primates evolved expanded color vision is to distinguish ripe from unripe fruit, or tender new leavesfrom older, tougher ones, in other words, telling goodfood apart from bad food, kind of like what these spiders are doing. Here, we've got this kind ofevidence in a jumping spider, and we're gonna repeatedly test that in other jumping spider species that have different forms of color vision. The team predicts that spiders with expanded colorvision will use color cues to their advantage. So they'll do betterwhen color can tell them which prey items taste bad. Species that can't seered won't get any benefit from the warning colors,or from the training. If the data support these predictions, these will be some of the firstexperiments in any species to reveal an evolutionaryadvantage to seeing and discriminating more colors. But feeding behaviorcan't be the whole story, because the spiders had somemore surprises in store. For example, there's agenus of jumping spiders in Central America called Mexigonus, where males and only males sport incredibly bright red colorson parts of their body that they use during courtship. We thought for sure the female has gotta bepaying attention to red, distinguishing it from other colors. They've gotta have red colorvision in some special way. And it turns out that atleast by our measurements, they don't have the ability to see red. They just have UV andgreen-sensitive cells in those principal eye retinas. I don't mind being proved wrong at all. It usually means something more exciting, because it means that, oh myGod, there's something cool and new in the world, right? And you've learned something new. So what's going on here? To help answer that question and maybe understand whysome spiders are displaying to one another with colors they can't see, it's time to revisit thejumping spider retina. Instead of just one retina like we have, they have a stack of translucent retinas right on top of each other. One thing that we thinkthat this layering does is to correct for a problem that the optics present to the retina. It's called chromatic aberration. Most optical materials,like these glass prisms, refract, or bend short wavelength light, like blue and UV, more strongly than long wavelength light, like red. That's chromatic aberration. Lenses do this, too. In photos taken withvintage camera lenses, you can often see a fringe of color around high contrast edges. The sensor in a camera is asingle flat layer of photosites. So getting the differentcolors of light to focus in the same plane is critical. Modern camera lenses correctfor chromatic aberration using complicated optical designs with lots of lens elements. But the other solution is to put different color-sensitivecells at the right depths behind the lenses, so that the colors that they're sensitiveto are in proper focus. That's exactly whatjumping spider retinas do, and this gets us one stepcloser to understanding what red might mean to a spiderthat can't actually see red. In the jumping spidereye, the cells sensitive to shorter wavelengths aregenerally closer to the lens, and those sensitive to longerwavelengths are farther away. But most jumping spiders are dichromats. They only have two cone cell types. So why have four layers in their retinas? [Nathan] Typically, the bottom, or farthest away from the lens two tiers, we call those tiers 1 and 2. Those are both typicallysensitive just to green light. And with a retina like that, an object in that world mightappear in different focus in tier 2 than in tier 1. [Derek] Researchers in Japan have shown that jumping spiders canactually use this discrepancy in focus to perceive depth and distance in their environment. But there is a liabilitywith this system. It only works if you're justusing one color of light, like green. If you start to mix inother colors of light, for example, red, thenthe system creates errors. Essentially, colors like redmight create this perception of being close, or beinglooming towards the receiver, and that would provide a totally different perceptualexperience for the viewer. So a jumping spider's redcoloration might not look red to another jumping spider, but instead create asort of depth illusion. But why would a male spider benefit from displaying an optical illusion? One thing about jumping spiders is that females often are quite aggressive towards prospective mates. In fact, they can often eat the male rather than allowinghim to mate with them. So these males, whenthey're dancing for females, are really actuallydancing for their lives in many instances. [Derek] If a femalethinks a male is closer than he really is, thatcould throw off her attack, or maybe confusing the femalepays off in other ways. If she can't quite figureout the male's display, she might stick around payingattention to it for longer, and this might result in better outcomes for the male at the end of courtship. [Derek] And amorousmale spiders might not be the only ones exploitingthese depth delusions. So imagine a red prey item. We might look at it andsay, \"That's probably toxic, \"and it's warning birds that it's toxic.\" But another possibility is that it's red simply to look like it'scloser to a jumping spider, so that it has a betterchance of escaping. We also see small insects with red and blue patterns on them, which would create a reallycomplicated visual illusion that might simply baffle it, and require it a longer period of time before it judge this distance. Even a split second can really matter. But in this tiny game of cat and mouse, a spider that could see anddiscriminate red from green would be a lot harder to fool, and this could be anothersurprising benefit of color vision, one that isn'treally about color at all. And what we really need to ask whether, or not thishypothesis is even plausible is really good highresolution measurements of the distances of things in their eyes, including the retina and thelenses, from live animals. [Derek] This informationyou can't just get from preserved specimenson microscope slides, but there is another way. (light music)(air whooshing) By using a particle accelerator called the Advanced Photon Source,the researchers have started to collect high resolution X-ray videos through the spider's exoskeletons. This has never been done before. It's in X-ray, so we cansee through their eyes, and we can see how theseeye tubes are moving around. [Derek] If the spider'sretinal movements change the shape, or length of their eye tubes, that'll affect what they'recapable of perceiving. It would change howthey experience depth. It would change how they experience color. Previously, this information has only been collected from dissections. So we're very excited to getsuper high resolution videos of the inside of the spider's head as it's performingcomplicated visual motions. Unfortunately, a few monthsafter their initial tests, the Advanced Photon Sourceshut down for upgrades that'll take over a year to complete. So it looks like we'll haveto wait a little longer for some of the answers theteam has been looking for. We know that the retinascan be moved around and that they maybe have betweena 50 and 60-degree travel. Not only can they be movedin the horizontal plane, but in the vertical plane, and they can actually be twisted to change the orientationof their field of view. The question is how dothese movements affect what the spiders can focuson, or how they sense depth, or even how they perceive color? It's this connection between focus, depth, and color that makes thesespiders so intriguing. It opens up all sorts of questions about what color is in the first place. (light music) It's already clearthat these spiders have a lot to teach us about color vision, how and why it evolves, and how many forms it can take even within a single group of animals. (gentle music) If our understanding of theirvisual system is correct, the experience of colorfor jumping spiders might even be three-dimensional in a way that's totally differentfrom how we see the world. And we haven't even talkedabout their other senses, like their ability tocommunicate through vibration. When you think about it, you realize that theuniverse we humans perceive, even with all our technology, is just a sliver of what's out there. (light music) If we owe anything to the world, it's to allow the world to be experienced in the fullness of itself. I think this is one of thetragedies of extinction is the loss of oftentimesa totally unique way of experiencing our world, a way of experiencing our world that we probably couldn't even imagine. So color, what is it? Is it an intrinsic property of an object, like Aristotle thought, or something that exists onlyin the mind perceiving it, like Galileo believed? Maybe it's not an either/or question. My belief is that coloris something that emerges through the evolution ofthe eyes that see the world and the world that the eyes see. Color as a thing emergesthrough this dance, this evolutionary dance between what can be sensed about the world and those that are sensing it. It's that dance playing outover millions of generations that created the colorfulworld we inhabit, and shaped the countless ways that we and our fellowlife forms experience it. (light music) (graphics beeping) Come to me. Okay, not that far. Ah! (Derek laughing) They're not called jumpingspiders for nothing. Yeah, come on."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: superglue"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Once it sets, you can literally hangfrom that one drop of adhesive. Oh my God. That is crazy. So how is superglue so strong? Well, that's what I want to find out. And along the way, we're going to learnhow it sets so quickly, why it's so good at sticking to skin,how it saves lives, and how it might even helpsolve our plastic pollution problem. Plus, if it's so strong, one single drop can easily lift over three tons. Why is it weak in certain circumstances? Mom is going to kill us. *scream* In 1942, the US was at war. And to accelerate the production of gunsights, the Eastman Kodak Company was looking for a clear plasticthat could be cast instead of grinding glass lenses. Chemist Harry Coover was working ona compound called cyanoacrylate. It looked promising, but it had the unfortunate tendencyto stick to everything it touched. Coover called it a severe pain. And as the war wound down,Kodak gave up on finding a plastic replacement and kept on makinggun sights out of glass. By 1951, Coover was again trying to develop a clear plastic. This time for jet plane canopies. If he could just solve the stickinessproblem, cyanoacrylate could work. Coover showed the material to his coworker Fred Joyner,but gave him strict instructions. I told him, look, don't take a refractiveindex of this material. If you do, you're goingto wreck the refractometer. Cos it\u2019s going to stick it together. But after testing 909other compounds, Joyner had forgotten. So he prepped the 910 test by smearingcyanoacrylate between two prisms. After taking the measurement, Joyner discoveredhe couldn't pull the prisms apart. He panicked. The refractometer, worth nearly $10,000 adjusted for inflation, was ruined. But instead of getting angry,Coover had a flash of insight. He got a sample of cyanoacrylateand began gluing together anything within reach. Glassplates, rubber stoppers, metal spatulas, wood, paper, in all different combinations. He said \u201cEverything stuck to everything almost instantly and with bondsI could not break apart.\u201d With this discovery, he dubbed the compound Eastman 910 Adhesive, as it was the 910th substancetested in the company's search. But nowadays,everyone calls this super glue. So how does it work so quickly withsuch strength on so many different things? Bonds almost anything. A plastic knob, a plastic plug, a rubber boot, a metal brooch, a fishing rod, a cyclegrip, model planes and model trains, a doorknob screw,a flashlight case, the broken trim on any car. Super glue in the tube is a liquid ofidentical monomer molecules. The molecule is ethyl cyanoacrylate. When you put it between two surfaces, the liquid flowsinto all the pores and crevices. Then the monomersstart reacting with each other, joining to form long polymer chains. This turns the glue from a liquid into a solid, and at this point it can no longer bepulled out of the cracks and crevices, so it's stuck in placeand the two surfaces are connected. If you're ever trying to glue surfacesthat are too smooth, this is probably the reasonsuper glue sticks poorly. There are few crevices or pores for itto cling to. To fix this, you can sand the surfacesto introduce some surface texture. That way when the liquid glue solidifies,it's stuck in the cracks. But what triggers the monomers to solidify instead of staying liquidlike they are in the tube? Well, ethyl cyanoacrylate is primed to react because it has two double bondsand one triple bond close together. What makes itso reactive is you have a double bond attached to a nitrile groupand an ester group. And the unique part aboutthat is the chemistry of those groups that make that double bond so electron deficient. The oxygen and the nitrogen atomsattract electrons more than the carbons. So that leaves this carbonslightly positively charged. It is hungry. It is looking. And anything even slightly electronegative,it will attack and it'll start a reaction. In the presence of a negative ion, the carbon double bond breaksand four single bonds form. But the nitrile and estergroups are so electronegative they pull the extra electron on across the molecule,making this carbon negative. That invites another slightly positive carbonon a separate monomer to attack. And now they're chemically linkedtogether. The start of a polymer chain. And once that goesnow it has the ability to go react with all those other super gluehungry monomers and rapidly polymerize. It's a really, really chemically reactivespecies. That single initiatorstarted a chain reaction. The next monomer again pulls across the electronand more and more monomers bond together, forming longer and longer chainsuntil the super glue has solidified. It normally takes between10 and 30 seconds to set. This was much faster than other adhesivesavailable in the 1950s. A lot of glues like whiteglue and glue sticks work by drying out, so you have to wait for the waterto evaporate. But with super glue it'salmost the opposite. While I was prototyping snatoms, I 3D printed these plastic shellsand super glued them together. One day I was trying to open a bottle ofsuper glue where the cap had gotten glued on to the nozzle,so I tried twisting it off with my teeth, but the bottle exploded,filling my mouth with super glue. And I was thinking, well,I might have a few seconds to spit it out with the saliva in my mouth before it set. But the super glue actually hardenedimmediately. It stuck to my teeth and my tongue. I had to get my now wife to pick itout of my teeth with tweezers. Luckily, it didn't glue togetheranything essential. I think it'sbecause it solidified so rapidly. And the reason it didthat is because the polymerization of super glueis actually triggered by water. Specifically, it's the slightly negativeoxygen atoms in the polar water molecule and the negative hydroxide ions in waterthat often break open the carbon double bond,initiating the formation of chains. And water is everywhere. I mean, there's moisture in the air, little bits of water on most surfaces,or absorbed into materials like fabrics. That's why super glue sets rapidlyon almost every surface. Each water molecule can initiatethe formation of a polymer chain. There's a forensic techniquethat uses super glue fumes to pull fingerprintsfrom non-porous surfaces. When you grab something,your hand leaves behind moisture and oils that are perfectfor super glue to bind with. And this also makesskin ideal to stick to. There are a lot of wrinkles and poresfor super glue to seep into. Plus, the protein collagen has a numberof negative regions that can initiate the polymerization reactionand bond directly with a monomer. So your skin is the perfect sortof surface for super glue to stick to. And that's why it's so hard to get off. Some of your molecules literallybecome part of the polymer chain. There's a medical case study where someonegot cyanoacrylate all over his hands. So he quickly went to wash it offwith soap and water. But that acceleratedthe polymerization reaction, and his hands were stuck together. So he went to multiple medicalprofessionals, and he got terrible advice. They tried alcohol, water and soap. They also attempted physical separation. And he went to consult cosmetic surgery. But finally someone suggested acetone. Acetone, or nail polish remover,dissolved the glue and released his hands. Now, unfortunately,the bottles for some types of super glue look incredibly similarto those for eyedrops. So there are hundreds of cases of peopleputting super glue directly into their eyes. In that case, acetone is not the solution. Don't try to separateyour eyelids, just seek medical attention. Super glue is strong. To demonstrate this and promotehis new product, Coover went on a game show. He showed thatwith only a single drop of glue, he could lift himselfand the host into the air. Here we go. One drop of glue. And after 24 hours, it would support somethinglike 15,000 pounds. One drop of glue. Now, doctor,you must be very proud of this. I imagine many years of researchwent into its discovery. No, as a matter of fact,it wasn't Gary. This discovery was purely by accident. Bully for you. Super glue polymers are almost all single chains running linearly between the surfaces. They have a directionality to them,kind of like wood grain. The chains are densely packedwith some cross-linking between them,and this makes the polymer fairly rigid. It's about as hard as a hard hat. This makes it strong in compression.Under tension, super glue is strongest when you pullin the same direction as the chains. The tensile strength of super gluecan be upwards of 25 mega pascals, which is similar to other polymers,meaning a square patch just five centimeters on a side could suspend afully grown African elephant. But super glue also has its weaknesses. It is brittle,so if there's a sudden impact, it just kind of falls apart. As a super glue is very quickly reacting. It usually produces really short polymer chains that have a matrix with built in stress. Any time you have stress in a material,it's a potential failure point. The thing that makes it a really goodadhesive is kind of its Achilles heel. in some cases. Polyethylene,polypropylene, nylons, like those squishy plastics. Their polymer chainsand their chemistry are such that they can absorb a lot of impact. If a force comesin, they'll kind of deform. Whereas in the chains of a super glue polymer,it doesn't have the ability to do that. So any impact will come and it'llphysically break those rigid bonds. And it'll also kind of be absorbedin those stress points, and it'll cause the whole thing to fracture. Super glue is alsoweak if a force is applied perpendicular to the polymer chains. That is, it's weak in shear.During this shear test, the stress releasesbreaking the super glue bond. So shear iskind of a combination of forces. So you kind of have like a compressionand like a friction going on. Tension is a pretty uni-directional force. And the polymerchains are able to deform enough. However, in shear you have a more dynamicset of forces going on. And and they're just kind of breaking upall at once. Shear force doesn't get spread evenly. It's highestat the edges and lower in the middle. And since super glue is so brittle, it can't redistribute this stress,causing the bond to fail. It's even worse if you grab oneend of a surface and try to peel it back. In that case,all that force is on a few polymers, so the chains break one by onelike a zipper unzipping. Two long bars super glued together could be strong since there's a lot of surface area. But if one end breaks,the rest can easily peel off. Now a bond breaking is bad, but there are some materials that super gluewon't even stick to at all. So here we have a milk bottle, and this ismade out of a plastic called polyethylene. I'm going to put one drop right here. But it's so weak you can see the glue has made a perfect little film and it doesn't stick whatsoever. The materialsthat super glue does not bond to. They fall in to category of materialsthat are known as chemically inert. And by inert it just means thatthey don't have reactive sites. So super glue is so reactivebecause it is so electron deficient. It's looking for any source of electrons. But you have a polypropyleneor a polyethylene or a Teflon. And carbon loves carbon,and carbon is not sharing its electrons. So there's nothing on the surfacethat is willing to donate any reactivity. Even if you add initiators, say,by spraying water, it still doesn't work. That's because these materialsare hydrophobic and non-porous. If you spray like, a polypropylene sheet, with water it'll just fall off, right? You know, if you can think of, like, the beating up of wateron a hydrophobic surface. So if you pour super glue on top of water, it'll just like, you'lljust get like a clump of super glue on it. And then you can just peel it off. Most super glue specifically warns against using it on polyethylene and polypropylenebecause it won't stick. But this is actually a good thing. You have to have something that super gluewon't stick to, so it can be contained and stored without setting. Super glue quickly found industrial applications. Its first sale was to Masonand Hanger in 1956, who used it to assemble atomic bombs. Soon, different additives were devisedto change the properties of pure ethyl cyanoacrylate. The monomers by themselves are very runny,almost like water, so companies added thickening agentslike fumed silica to turn it into a gel. Fumed silica forms branched structuresthat increase viscosity. Some acid is often addedto inhibit polymerization in the tube. If you want to speed up the settingof super glue, one way is to add more negative ions, the initiatorsthat start the polymerization reaction. You can buy accelerators specificallyfor this purpose off the shelf, but a number of DIYers and handymenuse baking soda - sodium bicarbonate. It reacts with moisture in the airto produce hydroxide ions. So when you add super glue, it sets evenfaster due to all those ion initiators. Plus, it forms a really hardcomposite substance. You can layer super glue and baking sodato strengthen a joint and fill gaps. It can even be drilled or sandedafter setting. It's interestingto see how baking soda in solution speeds up the polymerization of super glue. If you take pure water and pour in super glue, you get a bunchof little plastic droplets. The glue sets quickly, but not fast enoughto keep the whole stream connected. But with baking soda dissolved in the water,the super glue sets even faster. This creates a continuouslength of polymer, which is really cool to see, but the resulting plastic is fragile and can easily be crushed. If you wanna glue thingsunderwater with superglue, the key is actually to slowthe polymerization down. With a gel cyanoacrylate, thethickeners slow the reaction, giving you enough time toapply and detach objects. Wow, there it is: glued underwater. It's not even a perfect fit. I didn't put it together quiteright, but it\u2019s still stuck. One day, Coover's eldestson was making a model, when he accidentally cut his finger. As a quick-thinking andexperimentally-minded father, Coover got some super gluehe brought home from the lab and applied it to the cut. It instantly sealed shut. Coover immediately sawits potential in medicine, and he went to work. He envisioned a glue that couldcompletely replace sutures. But his team soon raninto three key problems: First, as super glue sets, all those bonds forming release heat. This is a standard cotton ball. Just gonna add some liquid super glue. 86. Oh my gosh, it's starting to smoke. 93, 99, 108. Whoo, made my eyes water. 120. If you do this at home, wear goggles, and probably a respirator,and probably do it outside. I'm feeling it now. Itis hot, hot to the touch. The cotton has a lot of surface area, and it's absorbed a lot of water, so the superglue setseven faster than usual and releases all its heat at once. If I get it on my skin, the temperature increasewouldn't be as dramatic, but it's enough to irritate a wound. The second problem is that over time, super glue in the body breaks down, and some of the things it breaks down into are toxic chemicals like formaldehyde. And finally, super glue ishard and brittle, unlike us. We are mostly just squishybags of meat and water. So an adhesive for livingtissue needs to be soft and flexible for the entireduration of the healing process. Remarkably, Coover andhis team found that all of these problems could be solved with a single change to the molecule: Simply increase the number ofcarbons in the alkyl chain. With longer carbonchains, it takes more time for the monomers to bind together, which slows down the rate of reaction. This slows the rate of heat released, so there's not a significanttemperature increase all at once. The longer polymers alsobreak down much more slowly, so the wound has enough time to heal before the glue startsreleasing toxins into the body. It's removed before that happens. And finally, since the reaction is slower, there's more time for themonomers to float around and form longer polymers. These longer polymerscan absorb stress better than shorter chains, meaning the glue can flexmore without breaking. With the main problems addressed, Coover submitted anapplication to the FDA in 1964 for medical superglue. The US military was veryinterested in Coover's adhesive, and they developed amedical super glue spray for use in the Vietnam War. The spray saved lives. In one case, a bullet hita 24-year-old soldier, passing through his kidney and liver. After part of his liver was removed, they gave him 12 liters of blood. That's enough to replace all the blood in his body twice over. But the bleeding just wouldn't stop. By conventional methods, he was gone. But then the surgeons sprayed superglue directly on the liver. The bleeding stopped, vitalsigns returned to normal, and the soldier recovered. Despite its success on the battlefield, medical superglue was heldup in bureaucratic red tape for years, so long that Cooverhad to abandon the project. It wasn't until 1998 that he saw his dream of a medical glue approved: a 2-octyl cyanoacrylate called Dermabond. Medical super glue has now grown to be a $900-million-a-year industry. In the 74 years sinceCoover's accidental discovery, cyanoacrylate has grown tobecome a $3 billion industry. But its impact doesn't stop there, because now scientists are turning to Coover's original research, exploring its use as a plastic, and it could well solve one of the biggest problems the planet faces: how to recycle the mountain ofplastic we produce each year. Manufacturers can shred, melt,and reform other plastics, but the polymers degrade,so the quality is worse and the process generates microplastics. So you can only recycle mechanically and thermally like thata certain number of times before you get a materialthat's kind of useless. It still will sit in the environment, and it won't break down,but it's not useful. [Derek] But superglue is unique. If you heat it up to 210 degrees Celsius, it'll break back down into pure monomers. These can be distilled and then reactivatedback into fresh polymer. We have a starting material, wemake it into a plastic, and then, under a certain stimulus, we can turn it back tothat starting material. So let's see if we canmake a plastic from this, you know, 'cause the goalof a depolymerizable plastic is that it's sustainable, right? There are just two problems: First, how do you cast something that sticks to basically everything? And second, super glueon its own is brittle, so how do you stop it from breaking? The big problem is the handleability. That was kind of the original problem. They found that, okay,this isn't a great plastic because it sticks to everything. That's how they discovered that it was an excellent adhesive. So we were faced with that same problem. But Coover didn't have themodern plastics we have today. Polypropylene, polyethylene,and Teflon are so inert, they don't activate superglue. So they are the perfectmaterials to handle the monomers. So we were able to actually handle it, so that was, you know, a huge check. We can actually work with this material. Next, to reduce brittleness,you need super glue to form long chains that tangle together. And this problem can actuallybe broken down into two parts. First, a lot of initiators means lots of short polymer chains. Second, as the superglue sets,the existing chains freeze and they can't connect together. There also might be some unused monomers that can't get into theright spot to attach. If you can solve both theseissues, you get longer chains. The first fix is to use a very weak base. By mixing in a littlebit of this weak base, there are enough initiators to start the polymerizationreaction, but not too many, so the polymer chains end up being longer. We use DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide, which, in no other context,would be used as an initiator, but it was just electronegativeenough that we were able to initiate a reactionthat could go slowly and proceed in a way thatproduced a nice solid plastic. [Derek] Next, you need asolvent, in this case, acetone. And what a solvent is, is it's just a medium thatdilutes the conditions. It does not participate in the reaction. Usually, it provides additional mobility. [Derek] After mixing the glue and initiator into the acetone, the mobile polymers areable to form even longer, more stable chains than usual. And after a while, all the superglue sets, the acetone evaporates, andthe new plastic is removed. To reuse it, just heat it up and distill it to getback superglue monomers. So I would, on average, get around 93%, which is excellent. [Derek] Compared to that, even the most widely recycled plastics can't return to the same quality, and they can only bedowncycled once or twice before ending up in landfill. I'm super glue's biggest fan, obviously, but I hope that it canactually have a real impact in terms of sustainability and kind of revolutionizinghow we look at plastics and how we look atmaterials that, you know, we've existed with for decades. You know, okay, what if weuse this for something else? Coover said it took the rightmindset to see cyanoacrylate as a great adhesive. The first time he worked with it, he was thinking about gun sightsand nothing but gun sights. Its sticky qualities were a pain. The second time he encountered it, his colleagues fixated onthe broken refractometer, but he could finally see the quality that frustrated him as a benefit. And then, after decades ofresearchers only viewing it as a useful adhesive, it tookanother flash of inspiration to see its potentialas a plastic once more. As Coover said, this shouldserve as a reminder to all of us to be open-minded and curious enough to pursue unexplained eventsand unexpected results, which may unlock new secrets and lead to new and excitingdiscoveries of the future. Coover's ability to look beyond roadblocks and see the breakthroughson the other side is a skill that every great innovator shares.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: how Japanese samurai swords, also known as katanas, are made through a traditional process from iron sand to finished blade"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "about how Japanese swords are made, swords that are strongenough and sharp enough to slice a bullet in half. The access we got forthis video is incredible. We were able to film everythingfrom gathering the iron sand to smelting the iron, forging the sword, to sharpening and polishing it. They even let us use it. [Petr] That is so cool! [Derek] The methodof making these swords has remained virtuallyunchanged for hundreds of years, with everything done by hand. They are still considered tobe among the best in the world. The Japanese made a weapon that was the absolute pinnaclefor their style of warfare and the materials they had at hand. These swords are heldin such high regard that one from the 16th century has been appraised at $105 million, making it the mostexpensive sword ever built. (sword thwacks)(dramatic music) (river noises) In the Shimane province of Japan there is a smelter that is litfor only one night each year where steel is made in thesame way it was 1300 years ago. It's known as the Tatara method, and only steel made in this way ends up in the very best Japanese swords. And we were invited to come film it. (drums and flute music) Just after 9:00 AM, theceremonial prayers are said and the fire is lit by a Shinto priest. Everyone that will be workingthis smelter will be here for at least the next 24 hours. That includes Veritasium producer Petr. I'm committed. We're gonna do this. It's gonna be fun. [Derek] Sword making in Japangoes back about 3000 years, but in those days, swordswere made out of bronze. We're not sure how peoplefirst learned to smelt metal, but it was likely related to pottery. In that you were using these rocky oars to make glazes and such for pottery under very controlled atmospheres. And then find maybe thepotters found metallic beads in the bottom of the furnacesthat they were firing it. This possibly gave them the idea. [Derek] Bronze wasdiscovered before steel because it's an alloy ofcopper, and usually tin, both metals with low enough melting points that they can be smeltedin regular pottery kilns. The problem with bronze is that although it can be sharpened, it's too soft to hold an edge for long. So Japanese sword makersshifted to steel 1200 years ago in the Heian period. This is what most people would recognize as a Japanese sword. It's made of steel with a curved blade. Steel is an alloy of iron, the fourth-most-commonelement in Earth's crust. The oceans of the world usedto be rich with dissolved iron. But two and a half billion years ago, cyanobacteria startedphotosynthesizing and creating oxygen. The iron reacted with that oxygen precipitating out of solution to be deposited at thebottom of the ocean. Incidentally, the cyanobacteriawere poisoned by the oxygen that they themselves produced so it's thought that whenlevels got high enough, they died off, and as aresult, oxygen levels dropped and iron no longerprecipitated out of solution. Then the cyanobacteriacould multiply again and the cycle repeated. That's why most of the world'siron is found in layers of sedimentary rock calledbanded iron formations. Each layer of iron was formed during a global flourishingof cyanobacteria that infused the ocean with oxygen. The majority of the global iron supply comes from these banded iron formations because of their highconcentration of iron, up to around 60% iron oxide by weight. (gentle music) But Japan, with itsmostly volcanic geology, has barely any of thesesedimentary iron oxides. And this is likely whythe country was late to the steel production game. Archeologists have foundsteel artifacts in Anatolia, which is modern day Turkey,that are nearly 4,000 years old. But in Japan, metals including steel, were imported from China and Korea up until the eighth century when Japan started making its own steel. So where did they get the raw ingredients? Well, igneous rockslike granite and diorite still contain iron oxides, just in much lower concentrations. But as the mountains are weathered, these iron oxides are brokenapart and washed downstream. Eventually they become part of the sand. The Japanese noticedthat because iron oxides are denser than otherminerals in the sand, they accumulate in places where the river changesdirection or speed. The heavier iron sinks to the bottom and the lighter material is washed away. To amplify this effect, they deliberately createddiversions in the river to increase the concentration of iron. What do you do is youdam off a section of river and then you drag sand into it. Because iron is heavier thanthe other parts of the sand, it is the thing that gets left behind and everything elsegets washed downstream. [Derek] With this method,you can get iron sands with 80% iron oxides by weight. That's more concentratedthan high-quality iron ore. And since it has fewer impurities, it's an excellent sourcefor high-quality steel. If you heat up those iron oxides to over 1,250 degrees Celsius, you can break the bonds withoxygen and get pure iron. But pure iron is actuallysofter than bronze. So in its elemental state,iron provides no advantage. But nature gave humans a lucky break. One of the few ways youcan heat something up to 1,250 degrees is with charcoal, and charcoal is basically pure carbon, and if you add just a littlebit of carbon to iron, it creates an incrediblystrong alloy: steel. Yeah, a lot of peoplesee it as a heat process. I see it as a chemical process. [Derek] Alloys are usuallystronger than pure metals because they containdifferent sized atoms, and this reduces the ability of atoms to slide past each other whenan external force is applied. So I've just been given gloves,other gloves, and a towel. So things are very much getting real. I'm genuinely quite worried. (serious music) Here is the room with all of the charcoal that we're going to be using overnight. There's just bags and bags of this stuff. (charcoal rattles) (flame crackles) There's a Buddhist saying: \"Before enlightenment,chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment,chop wood, carry water.\" So we're lining up on thefour corners, I guess. (charcoal rattles) Oh. Oh boy. Didn't do a great job of that. (chuckles) (thunder rumbles) So the rain is coming, so we're quickly gettingall of the charcoal out and then measuring it. So each bag of these is 10 kilos. Okay. (serious music) So with the iron sand, itis mixed together with water because if you don't mix it with water and you put it on the flame,it just flies straight up. But if you mix it with too much water, then there is water that's gonna heat up. It's gonna become water vapor, and the whole kiln could explode. Terrifyingly enough, they do this by feel. They mix in enough wateruntil the iron sand is clumpy. But again, if it's too much,the whole thing could explode. Okay, put some iron in. It is just past four in the afternoon, and over the last couple of hours we have added 250 kilograms of charcoal and nearly 60 kilograms of iron sand. So yeah, it's a slow process, but I think we'restarting to get somewhere. I have no idea becauseobviously the thing is hidden, but it should be growing. [Derek] To achieve the high temperatures required to make steel, you need a strong,steady supply of oxygen. For hundreds of years, this was provided by hugefoot-operated bellows. It would've taken anaround-the-clock, full-body effort by many men to maintainthe furnace's temperature. When I came here, I was a little bit sad thatthe bellows were electric. I really wanted to, you know,have this proper experience, have this proper workout of stepping on these bellows for 24 hours. (serious music) [Derek] The temperatureinside the smelter gets up to 1500 degrees Celsius, just below the melting pointof iron, which is 1538 Celsius. So the iron being smelted isn't liquid, but it's soft and malleable enough to clump together intoa big block of iron. No matter how highquality the iron sand is, there will always be some impurities, like sulfur, phosphorus,and silicon oxides. They combine with carbon from the charcoal and melt at a lower temperature than iron, so they become liquidand flow to the bottom. This is known as slag. After many more hours ofadding charcoal and iron sand, it is time for the firstremoval of the slag. Before the first removal ofslag, another prayer is said. (steelworkers clap) Oh, that's insane. (slag sizzles) (serious music) (hammer pinging) Whoa. So for the last three hours, there's been three processesthat we've been doing. One is adding the charcoal,two is adding the iron sand, and three is opening upthe smelter from the bottom to break apart the impuritiesso they can flow out. (shovels scrape) Just want you guys to knowthat it's 3:16 in the morning and I'm still here and I'm really sleepy. (subdued music) So it's currently six o'clockin the morning the next day. We've been smelting for 21 hours. I'm exhausted, but thesun is about to come out and it's been prettyamazing, I gotta be honest. We gotta close these doors really quick before they get mad at me. [Derek] At 9:00 AM the next morning, the smelting is complete. A total of 614 kilograms of iron sand and 670 kilograms of charcoalwere added to the smelter. At this point, in a traditional smelter, the only way to get the steel out would be to break it apart. These days, a crane is used to take the smelter apart. [Petr] Oh wow, okay. Oh! [Derek] And what is left toshow for all that hard work is a 100 kilogram blockof steel, iron, and slag. Only around a third of thisblock is high enough quality to be used in sword making. (crane whirs and clunks) Oh, that's insane. That's so cool. The result for all the hard work. This is step one ofmaking a Japanese sword. (subdued music) [Derek] The steel is sortedby quality and carbon content, which is also done by eye, in fact, this is one ofthe exams you need to pass to be certified as a swordsmith. Then, the different gradesof steel are sent out to one of 300 swordsmithsaround the country. Only 30 do it as their full-time job, and one of them is Akihara Kokaji, who we went to visit next. This is when the forgingof the sword begins. In a coal oven with hand-pumped bellows, the steel is heated untilit is soft and malleable. Then using hammers, the master swordsmithflattens out the steel. In the old days, this would'vebeen done by the swordsmith and three apprentices. The swordsmith using a smallerhammer, would set the rhythm and the apprentices would use big mallets to flatten the steel. (hammers clank)(Petr grunts) Woo. That was terrifying. [Derek] These days,electric hammers are used. When the steel is flat enough, it is then bent back on itself, (fire crackles) and it is then hammered again to press the steel backtogether into a solid block. (gentle music) So why go to all thiseffort flattening the steel, only to fold it back on itself and end up with a chunk ofsteel the same size as before? Well, because folding doestwo very important things. First, it spreads out the impurities like silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus. It spreads them out throughout the steel. This ensures a uniform consistencywithout any weak points. Second, it gives the steel a grain. After folding the sword,it is now reinforced in the direction that itwill be hit in combat, and as a bonus, the steelis exposed to the air. So there is a small amount of oxidation creatinga darker colored steel, which when folded makesbeautiful patterns. There are some swords whichhave more than a billion layers. Now this doesn't mean the sword has been folded a billion times since every fold doublesthe number of layers, so you only need about 30folds to get a billion layers. But usually a sword isfolded 10 to 13 times, resulting in a fewthousand layers of steel. Now a blade isn't made froma single block of steel. The carbon content affectshow hard the steel is. So different carbon percentages are used in different parts of the blade. Because carbon atoms aremuch smaller than iron atoms, they can fit inside thecrystal lattice of iron. These trapped carbon atoms then apply an outward force to the lattice putting the steel under stress. The higher the carbon percentage, the harder and more rigid the steel. But this hardness comes at a cost. The steel becomes brittle, making it more likely to chipand shatter rather than bend. So what swordsmiths do is they use steel withdifferent carbon contents for different parts of the blade. The edge is always high carbon steel to make it hard and rigid so it can maintain a sharpedge for a long time. But the spine is usuallymade of lower-carbon steel, which allows the swordto flex without breaking. This is done by weldingtogether pieces of steel with different carbon contents. So we have about a 15-minute break because you know it takesa while for the iron to heat up and then meld together, and then we're back in there. It's very hot. It'svery, very hot in there. It's kind of unbelievable that he can do this forfour hours at a time. [Derek] After the swordis hammered into shape, which is a straight blade, itis covered in a layer of clay, a thick layer for the spine, and a thin layer for the blade itself. It's then heated in the furnace and then rapidly cooled in water, a process known as quenching. Now, because the layers of clayhave different thicknesses, the rate of cooling is fasterfor the edge than the spine. When the steel is heated,carbon enters the iron lattice, and since the spine of thesword is covered in thick clay, it will cool slowly, giving time for the carbonatoms to leave the iron matrix. This will lead to a verylow-carbon steel called ferrite, but the carbon atomswhich have left the matrix will be caught by other iron atoms and created a type ofsteel known as cementite. The combination of ferrite and cementite is known as perlite, and it's a mostly softand ductile form of steel, though parts of it arehard due to the cementite. So per light forms the spine of the sword. In contrast, the very thinlayer of clay on the blade means that it cools very rapidly, so more of the carbon istrapped in the lattice. This forces the lattice structure to change from cubic to tetragonal making a form of steelknown as martensite. Since the trapped carbonputs stress on the lattice, martensite is incredibly hard, exactly what you'd wantfor the edge of a sword. The tetragonal latticestructure of martensite also takes up more space so the edge of the bladeexpands relative to the spine, curving the sword backwards. The iconic curve of a samurai sword comes from the formation of martensite. You can actually see the boundary between different types ofsteel in a finished sword by the difference in color. This is known as hamon, whichliterally means edge pattern. At the Victoria Albert Museum in London, there is a Japanese sword that has a very detailedlittle dragon in the hamon, and I've looked at it many times. I don't, okay, I don't knowhow he did that. (laughs) [Derek] About one third of all blades shatter during the quenching process. You quench it once and you thank the stars that you made it. [Derek] The sword is thenplaced back in the forage to evaporate any remaining water. This also provides a little bit of energy to loosen some of the crystal structures making the sword less brittle. And that's about the extent of the tempering processon a Japanese sword, which that that might beenough to relax things a bit, but they kept the edge much harder than you would've in the West. [Derek] After the sword is forged, it is sent to a polisher. The polishing and sharpening of a sword is also done by hand with whetstones of different coarsenesses. It can take a month to sharpenand polish a single sword. One of the things thatI love is that like, this table is sloping down and the entire floor overthere is sloping down. So when you like add the water, all of the residue and all the water, you know, flows downhillso it's not perfectly flat. (hammer taps softly) [Derek] Sometimes the swords are also engraved with beautiful patterns, though this is quite rare. And after all that, the sword is done. To learn how to use a Japanese sword, Petr got a lesson from amaster, Takara Takanashi. He is the 10th-generation student of Miyamoto Musashi, a legendary samurai. Musashi killed his firstopponent in single combat at the age of 13. He spent the rest of his lifeperfecting his sword-fighting, inventing a new technique with two swords. Musashi fought in morethan 60 duels to the death, and he won every last one of them. (serious music) (subdued music) There is a story about a duel that took place during a snowstorm. As he faced his opponent,katana outstretched, Musashi was so calm andkept his sword so still that snowflakes began to accumulate on the thin edge of the blade. [Petr] So during the lesson, I thought I would get to use a katana, but instead we spent the entire time learning how to take theblade out of its sheath and then put it back in. So when I actually gotthe chance to use a katana to slice through some things,I was deeply unprepared. (katana thuds) (playful music) [Producer] Well, itlooks like it's your turn. I'm so scared. Okay, so this has been an amazing day. We've looked at some beautiful katanas, and now these wonderfulpeople are letting me use one of their just unbelievablybeautiful pieces of art to chop some things. (Petr exhales forcefully) (katana thuds)- Oh. Oh. Woo! Like this is kind of the best day ever. (subdued music) [Derek] There reallyis something remarkable about Japanese swords. The amount of care,attention, and expertise that each step requires, from the gathering andrefining of the iron sand to the smelting, to the forging and sharpening a sword, each step takes so much time and skill. It's incredible that allthese things were discovered by trial and error to produceartifacts of such high quality that they are stillprized centuries later. (steelworkers speaking Japanese) (steelworkers clap) [Derek] Before I made this video, I didn't really appreciate that swords can be art. To me, it's a good reminderthat whatever you do, you should do it with deepcare, attention to detail, and love for the craft. (both speaking Japanese) Do that enough times and you might just makesomething beautiful. (audio chimes and warbles) Hey, this part of the video was brought to you by Henson Shaving. You know, making highquality things is hard, and as far as I'm concerned, Henson make the highest-qualityrazors in the world, the katanas of the shavingworld, if you will. I've been using their AL-13razor for the last year, and it's the best razorI've used by a long margin. One of the reasons for that is Henson really understandsthe physics of shaving, because as aerospacemachinists for 20 years, they understand how tocut things effectively. They get precision. Human hair is much harder thanthe skin it's growing out of, and as a result, typical razors drag and pull on the hair while cutting. What a multi-bladerazor does is it assumes that the first cut will be ineffective, and so they build in extrablades to cut the hair before it can snap back into position. And that does result in a good cut, but it also increases friction leading to razor burn and skin irritation. Henson carefully studied that problem and realized that you didn'tneed to add extra blades, you just needed to properlysupport a single blade. Virtually every razor on allows for too much play in theblade, but Henson doesn't. The result is an effective cut without the additionalfriction on your skin. Seriously, a Henson istruly a great razor. It'll last you a lifetime. You will get a bettershave with less irritation, and you'll also savemoney in the long run. So head over tohensonshaving.com/veritasium or scan the QR code here and enter code \"veritasium\"for a hundred free blades with a purchase of any razor. I wanna thank Henson Shavingfor supporting Veritasium, and I wanna thank you for watching."}]}

they're not under any tension whatsoever so they're not actually carrying any weight what's going to happen if you cut the green rope you can pause the video here and No text try to figure it out for yourself wait what here it is in slow motion so even though the ropes on the side were slack and we cut the only rope in tension the weight somehow went up okay so if you're unconvinced that cutting the green rope actually makes the weight go up here's a huge version of the experiment so the black and red ropes are still very much slack and it's just held together by this tiny piece of green rope here so let's see what happens now okay you ready [Music] okay three two one [Music] that was actually insane that was pretty pretty good right i still don't believe it looking at it okay so why does this actually happen cuz the springs are contracting back and just pulling it together maybe the tension in the you know this part is changed it releases the tension in the springs and only goes to the length of the ropes look at what happens when you remove the slack side ropes from the initial setup you're left with this a mass hanging from a spring hanging from another spring so these springs are connected in series obviously when you hang a weight from one spring it extends just like you'd expect and the amount it extends by call it X is proportional to the force exerted by the weight that's Hook's law but if you add another spring in between in series now both springs extend roughly the same amount X because both springs feel the same force of the weight pulling from below so in the case of ideal massless springs you would end up with exactly 2x of displacement now there's another way to connect these two springs to the weight and that is in parallel this way both springs are independently connected to the hook above and to the weight so each spring is only carrying half the weight of the mass below which is why both springs extend only half as far or x over two if you look at the setup right after the green rope is cut you'll notice that this is actually exactly how the springs are laid out so the red rope is connecting the bottom spring directly to the hook above and the black rope is connecting the top spring to the weight so these springs are in parallel so by cutting the green rope you're actually forcing the springs to go from a series to a parallel and that change is what causes the contraction to happen when you cut the rope each spring only extends by about half as far as before which is why you can add so much slack on these black and red ropes to give the impression that the weight is going to fall down when you cut the rope you go from series to parallel and that pushes you up the slack ropes that's where I get to cheat and that that's that's the misleading bit you know the key to getting this paradox right comes down to the length of the slack ropes each one has to be longer than the length of one of the springs in series plus the green rope that's what adds the slack but they also can't be much longer than that because too much slack will nullify the contraction you get between series and parallel and the weight will still fall now you might think that this paradox only really works with the springs in this demo but the first time it was discovered was actually because of its influence on people No text in April of 1990 New York was getting ready for its 20th annual Earth Day it was going to be Manhattan's biggest celebration of environmentalism to date stop the war against the Earth on the day Central Park was turned into a massive festival ground with almost a million people pouring in to see a stacked lineup of performers including Hallen Oats and the B-52s but the boldest stunt of the day was to ban traffic on some of New York's most important streets including 42nd Street one of the busiest streets in Manhattan it stretches from river to river connecting Time Square to Grand Central Station and it's almost always jammed with slowmoving traffic the only thing that's an hour from 42nd Street is 43rd Street and maybe not surprisingly people were really against this idea insisting that just a 6-hour closure of 42nd Street would mean doomsday as the commissioner of New York's Department of Transportation put it you didn't need to be a rocket scientist or have a sophisticated computer queuing model to see that this could have been a major problem but the city went ahead with it anyway and no cars were allowed on 42nd Street for the day now to everyone's surprise the traffic in the surrounding area actually got better the number of cars was reduced by 20% with bystanders claiming the whole area was a ghost town compared to the way it normally is but one man wasn't surprised by this result in fact he No text predicted it over 20 years earlier his name was Dietrich Braze a German mathematician and back in 1968 Braze was studying road networks as part of his research he imagined a scenario where drivers from one side of a fictional town were trying to get to the other but there were only two possible routes the drivers could take route one starts with a wide highway that takes you halfway across town the road is so wide that regardless of how many cars are on it this part of the trip always takes 25 minutes the second half of this route turns into a narrow city street and the time to drive through this street depends on how many cars are on it for every 100 cars on the street the time to pass through it takes an additional minute so 100 cars will take 1 minute 200 cars will take 2 minutes and so on the second route through town starts with a similar narrow city street that depends on the number of cars it takes you halfway across and then turns into another 25-minute highway stretch where the transit time doesn't depend on traffic so which route would you take to get across town well you can see that the routes are identical but flipped so it doesn't really matter since this is just a mathematical model both will get you there at the same time so say there were 2,000 drivers trying to get across the city half of the cars would end up on the first route and half on the second route and since there are now 1,000 cars going down each narrow city street the travel time on these segments increases to 10 minutes so the total time on both routes is 10 minutes for the narrow street plus 25 minutes for the highway a total of 35 minutes regardless of route but now say the city decides to connect these two routes at the halfway point with a small piece of highway to give drivers more options this piece only takes a minute to travel across so which roads would you use now to get across town well as an individual driver you should just go straight down it will take you 10 minutes to get through the first city street 1 minute on the new connecting road and another 10 minutes for the second street so your total journey time would now be only 21 minutes compared to the 35 minutes for everyone else on routes 1 and two okay No text great so you minimize your own time and that's that right well not really see drivers like you are selfish and everyone wants the shortest possible travel time which means everyone starts flooding the narrow city streets as drivers switch to this new shortcut the narrow streets become more and more congested making the route slower and slower but this makes the original routes worse too because the time to get through the street segments keeps increasing for every driver so everyone decides to switch to the shortcut and now all 2,000 cars are driving down the city streets now the time to traverse each city street jumps to 20 minutes so the total journey time for everyone increases to a whopping 41 minutes compared to the 35 minutes we had before the new road was constructed so traffic actually got worse for everyone to fix it the drivers could simply go back to their original routes right well who's going to be the first to switch back if any one driver goes back to Route 1 or two their journey time will be the 25 minutes on the highway plus 20 minutes on the now congested city streets or 45 minutes in total which is even worse than the now congested streets so no single driver would ever want to go back to the original route and because humans are humans it's not like we could all just agree to ignore this new road so even though every driver was making a rational decision to try to minimize their own travel time by just using the city streets collectively this made the situation worse for everyone and there's no way out but if the city were to destroy this new connecting road everyone's journey time would drop from 41 minutes back to the original 35 minutes on route 1 and two so removing the road would actually make the traffic better it's just like cutting the green rope from before that's because both of these are examples of the same paradox the springs are like the narrow city roads the more weight or cars you add the longer they get and the ropes are like the highways it doesn't matter how much weight is on them they don't change that is unless you don't know how to tie them properly my god this is the paradox Dietrich Braze discovered in 1968 it's now known as Brazy's paradox and it is the reason why New York traffic got better after 42nd Street was closed on Earth Day now sure you'd be right to argue that the reason the traffic decreased on Earth Day in New York was simply because people decided to walk or cycle more that day but it turns out mathematicians actually modeled the whole city in 2008 and they found 12 roads that were redundant and could be cut to actually reduce traffic and it's not only New York the paradox showed up in Boston London Seoul in fact if you were to randomly add a new road to just about any city you'd have an equal chance of making the traffic better as worse but there's nothing special about the flow of cars say instead you want to send electricity from one station to another well now you're looking at the flow of electrons in a power grid and just as before you could try to improve the grid by increasing the capacity of existing lines or by adding new lines but it turns out that this can actually destabilize the grid or even cause a blackout and virtually any other network anytime you're sending things from one place to another it can fall prey to Brazy's paradox be it a food chain blockchain or even the internet adding elements to the network can make it worse so less can actually be more and that kind of got me thinking it's the same with your data on the internet the less of your private info is on the web the better see I got an email from someone a couple of months ago

work consistently you get this so we're here No text at the Amolf Institute where they actually figured out how to make something shrink when you pull it so let's go check it out is it here yeah I made all these samples that's so weird yeah right i guess you never expect things to yank back on you so unexpectedly cuz a rubber band you're stretching it and you feel it wants to pull back on you more and more but here it just you're never ready for freezing suddenly which it's a weird feeling there's something almost like human about it where it starts tugging back on you when it gets bad what's special about this mechanism is that everything else around us works in the complete opposite way try to press one of your keyboard buttons slowly so that it steadily goes down into place you can't do it no matter how slowly you go there is some point at which it just gives way and clicks through the same happens if you try to stretch a bendy straw you can pull on it as slowly as you like but at some point the individual straw joints are going to expand suddenly light switches eyeglasses grasshopper legs these all have a failure point beyond which they give way and quickly snap into a different position and this is called well snapping here it is mapped to a force displacement graph as you'd expect the more force you apply the more the material bends or displaces but eventually you reach a tipping point and beyond it the force required to bend the material further actually drops so if you apply a force higher than that peak the displacement has to rush to the next corresponding value to match the force which is all the way on the other side of this dip and as a result you get a huge amount of displacement for that tiny increase in force that's what creates the sudden snap it's very intuitive i mean you've all experienced it at least if you're in the Netherlands with your umbrella there's a gust of wind underneath your umbrella it pops to the other side so you sort of go over a peak in energy or in force and it suddenly snaps and typically it becomes softer and this is the way all things snap everything used to fail in the direction of the applied force until this mechanism came about doing the exact opposite of snapping call it counter snapping imagine that gust of wind blows under your umbrella but instead of flipping out your umbrella suddenly closes in or you try to pull apart a straw and the joints suddenly contract the wind is pushing on my umbrella but instead of it folding out it would push itself against the wind to close itself right but it feels like it violates physics it It's just so so counterintuitive that the displacement is in in the other direction to the force that's why it's fun so how does No text this thing work well the mechanism itself is built out of three different components and on their own they all stretch normally when you try to pull them apart individually they behave like springs in the sense that they extend when you pull on them but then you combine them together and then suddenly they shrink exactly if you draw the system as a set of springs it looks something like this the long and lanky components represent the two springs on the sides but they actually don't feel like springs at all you can easily pull them apart until they suddenly get very stiff meanwhile these pieces represent the top and bottom springs and they feel a lot more springy so the more you pull them the more they pull back and finally the central piece it looks very similar to the previous one but pulling it apart feels very snappy in fact you can even hear it snap out put them all together and you get the mechanism if you stretch it slowly you'll see how tension builds up in the three middle pieces with the sides staying mostly relaxed but if you keep stretching the centerpiece will suddenly snap out and transfer most of its tension to the side springs this causes the system to stiffen and shrink if you now let go the system resets so the mechanism can flip between a set of springs in series to one in parallel it's a reversible case of Brazy's paradox the network is basically the same as the brush paradox so the the way they connected the topology of the connection is exactly the same the force displacement graph you get for the mechanism is one that loops in on itself with two distinct curves one for the system in series and the other for the system in parallel and this leads to some pretty remarkable properties if you slowly control the stretching force by adding water to a cup below the mechanism the mechanism first slightly sags like you'd expect but when you reach the tipping point at the end of this curve the displacement has to quickly reduce to keep following the force along the graph and this jump back is why the mechanism shrinks now you can also control displacement instead of force and measure how much force it takes to stretch the mechanism at any point this time when you reach the tipping point it's the force that has to follow displacement along the graph so you get a sudden jump up in force showing that the material has stiffened oh this little force jump is enough to make it slip out of your hands if example I mean it even though you said it is a small jump it's like this is the only thing that does this anywhere probably on Earth uh yeah as far as we know the force jumping like this it was not reported it is pretty insane so what is counter snapping actually useful for well notice that there is a force at which the series and parallel curves of the system overlap which means that at this force the mechanism will actually be the same length in both states so if you exert that exact force on the structure by for example hanging a weight from it you can flip between the two states by giving the mechanism a little tug and although that will change whether the springs are in series or parallel it won't change how long the system actually is so you can change the stiffness without changing the length now look at what happens if you give the mechanism a nudge in its original series state if you poke it you it's basically a way to measure the natural frequency oh yeah when the mechanism is in series the natural frequency is 3.7 hertz but if you switch to a parallel setup the natural frequency increases to 6.4 4 hertz we switch it and we look at the natural frequency now we can see it's much higher what's unique here is that you're able to almost double the natural frequency of the material without changing its length i'm going to move the robot robotic arm very slightly just up and down yeah okay and I put a frequency of 3.5 hertz so it's close to the natural frequency of this system this is going to drive the structure into resonance but once the vibrations get big enough the mechanism is actually going to switch states on its own change its natural frequency and thereby reduce the vibrations like it gets stronger and stronger and then it just locks it out yeah that's cool the same happens in reverse if you vibrate the robot hand at 6.4 hertz the mechanism is quickly going to switch back to its original state and minimize the vibrations it's interesting uh the way that you say it we're moving the point at which resonance happens and that's what stops excessive vibrations interesting yeah other snapping structures could also switch upon resonance but the problem that once they switch they're much more elongated much more contracted so they don't let's say they wouldn't provide the same function you could use this effect to keep structures from vibrating or reaching resonance could it be easier to install a system like this where you're actually moving the resonance instead of like a whole tune mass damper or or something like that yeah I think this solution is still very complex it's very complicated design but I think the principle could be used i know it's still super early but I'm really excited to see like it pop up somewhere you know in a couple of years or decades it's more about the concept and showing what it can do we're going to try to see if we can maybe make contra snapping also maybe with different type of variables it's going to be like a balloon that deflates when you inflate it you increase the pressure and the volume would decrease wait really that's crazy that would be the equivalent but we it's not there yet but we'll see that's so cool in principle it should be possible"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: history and current status of the search for odd perfect numbers"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "that dates back 2000 years. Some of the brightestmathematicians of all time have tried to crack it,but all of them failed. In the year 2000 the Italian mathematician,Piergiorgio Odifreddi, listed it among four of themost pressing open problems at the time. Solving this problem could be as simple as finding a single number. So mathematicians have used computers and checked numbers up to10 to the power of 2,200, but so far they've come up empty handed. Why do you think this problemhas captured the imaginations of so many mathematicians? It's old, it's simple, it's beautiful. What else could you want? So the problem is this. Do any odd perfect numbers exist? So what is a perfect number? Well take the number six for example. You can divide it by 1, 2,3, and 6, but let's ignore 6 because that's the number itself, and now we're left withjust the proper divisors. If you add them all up, youfind that they add to six, which is the number itself. So numbers like this are called perfect. You can also try this withother numbers like 10. 10 has the proper divisorsone, two, and five. If you add those up, you only get eight. So 10 is not a perfect number. Now you can repeat thisfor all other numbers, and what you find is thatmost numbers either overshoot or undershoot between 1 and a 100, only 6 and 28 are perfect numbers. Go up to 10,000 and you find the next twoperfect numbers 496 and 8,128. These were the only perfect numbers known by the ancient Greeks, and they would be the only known ones for over a thousand years. If only we could find a patternthat makes these numbers, then we could use thatto predict more of them. So what do these numbers have in common? Well, one thing to notice is that each next perfectnumber is one digit longer than the number that came before it. Another thing they share isthat the ending digit alternates between 6 and 8, which alsomeans they are all even. But here's where things get really weird. You can write 6 as thesum of 1 plus 2 plus 3 and 28 as the sum of one, plus 2, plus 3, plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7, and so on for the others as well,they're all just the sum of consecutive numbers and you can think ofeach additional number as adding a new layer. And so these create a triangle, which is why these numbersare called triangular numbers. Also, every numberexcept for six is the sum of consecutive odd cubes. So 28 is 1 cubed plus 3 cubed. 496 is equal to 1 cubed plus 3 cubedplus 5 cubed plus 7 cubed. And 8,128 is equal to 1 cubed plus 3 cubedplus 5 cubed plus 7 cubed plus 9 cubed all the way up to 15 cubed. But here's the one thatreally blows my mind. If you write these numbers in binary, six becomes 110, and 28 becomes 11100. 496 becomes 111110000. And 8,128, you guessed it. It is also a string of onesfollowed by a series of zeros. So if you write them out, they are all justconsecutive powers of two. What now around 300 BC Euclid was actuallythinking along similar lines when he discovered the pattern that makes these perfect numbers. Take the number one and double it, you get two now, keep doubling it. You get 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. Now starting from one,add the next number to it. So 1 plus 2 equals 3. If that adds up to aprime, then you multiply it by the last number in thesequence to get a perfect number. So two times three equalssix, the first perfect number. Now let's keep doing this. Add 1 plus 2 plus 4, and you get 7, which is again prime. So multiply it by the lastnumber four, and you get 28. The next perfect number. Next, add 1 plus 2 plus4 plus 8 equals 15, but 15 isn't prime, so wecontinue add 16 to get 31, this is prime. So you multiply it by 16 and you get 496. The third perfect number. Now you can keep doing this to find bigger and bigger perfect numbers, and using this we canrewrite the first three. So 6 equals 1 plus 2times 2 to the power of 1 and 28 equals 1 plus 2plus 4 times 2 squared and 496 equals 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 plus 16 times 2 to the power of 4 where the first term is prime. But there's a more convenientway to write this still. Take any sum of consecutive powers of 2. So 2 to the power of zero which is 1 plus 2 to the 1 plus 2 to the 2, all the way up to 2 to the n minus 1. And now because you don'tknow n, you don't know what that is equal to, but itwill be equal to something. So let's call that T. Now multiply this whole equation by two. So you get 2 to the 1 plus 2 to the 2, all the way up to 2 to then, and this is equal to 2T. If you now subtract the firstequation from the second, almost all the terms will cancel out and you're left with Tequals 2 to the n minus 1. So you can replace this whole series with one less than the next power of 2. So six becomes 2 squaredminus 1 times 2 to the 1. 28 becomes 2 cubedminus 1 times 2 squared, and 496 becomes 2 to the 5minus 1 times 2 to the 4. Do you see the pattern? This number is always one more than this. So if we call this P, then Euclid formula that gives a perfect numberis 2 to the P minus 1 times 2 to the P minus 1whenever this is prime. Now, because you're multiplyingit by 2 to the P minus 1, which is even, this willalways give an even number. Euclid had found a way togenerate even perfect numbers, but he didn't prove thatthis was the only way. So there could be otherways to get perfect numbers, including potentially ones that are odd. 400 years later, the Greek philosopher nicomchaus published Introdutio Arithmetica, thestandard arithmetic text for the next thousand years. In it, he stated five conjecturesstatements he believed to be true, but did not botheractually trying to prove. His conjectures were one, the nth perfect number has n digits. Two, all perfect numbers are even. Three, all perfect numbersend in 6 and 8 alternately. Four, Euclid algorithm producesevery even perfect number. And five, there are infinitelymany perfect numbers. For the next thousand years no one could prove or disproveany of these conjectures, and they were considered facts. But in the 13th century, Egyptian mathematician Ibn Fallus published a list with 10 perfect numbers and their values of P. Three of these perfect numbers turned out not to be perfect at all. But the remaining ones are. The fifth perfect numberis eight digits long, which disproves Nicomachus'sfirst conjecture. And the next thing to noticeis that both the fifth and sixth perfect number end in a 6. So that disprovesNicomachus's third conjecture that all perfect numbersend in a 6 or 8 alternately. Two conjectures were proven false. But what about the other three? Two centuries later, the problemreached Renaissance Europe where they rediscovered the fifth, sixth, and seventh perfect numbers. So far every perfectnumber had Euclid's form. And the best way to find newones was by finding the values of P that make 2 to the P minus 1 prime. So French polymath MarinMersenne extensively studied numbers of this form. In 1644, he published his in a book including a list of 11 values of P for which he claimedthey corresponded to primes. Numbers for which this is true are now called Mersenne Primes. Of his list the first seven exponents of P do result in primes and they correspond to thefirst seven perfect numbers. But for some of the larger numbers like 2 to the 67 minus1, Mersenne admitted to not even checkingwhether they were prime. \"To tell if a given numberof 15 to 20 digits is prime or not all time would notsuffice for the test.\" Mersenne discussed theproblem of perfect numbers with other luminaries of the time, including Pierre deFermat and Rene Descartes. In 1638, Descartes wrote toMersenne, I think I can show that there are no even perfect numbers except those of Euclid. He also believed that if anodd perfect number does exist, it must have a special form. It must be the product of a prime and the square of a different number. If he was right, thesewould easily have been the biggest breakthroughson the problem since Euclid 2000 years earlier. But Descartes couldn't proveeither of those statements. Instead, he wrote \"As forme, I judge that one can find real odd perfect numbers. But whatever method youuse, it takes a long time to look for these.\" Around a hundred years laterat the St. petersburg Academy, the Prussian mathematicianChristian Goldbach met a 20-year-old math prodigy. The two stayed in touchcorresponding by mail, and in 1729, Goldbachintroduced this young man to the work of Fermat. At first, he seemed indifferent, but after a little moreprodding by Goldbach he became passionate about number theory and he spent the next 40 years working on different problems in the field among them was the problemof perfect numbers. This Prodigy's name was Leonhard Euler. Euler picked up whereDescartes had left off, but with more success. In doing so, he made threebreakthroughs on this problem. First in 1732, he discovered the eighth perfectnumber, which he had done by verifying that 2 tothe 31 minus 1 is prime. Just as Mersenne had predicted. For his other two breakthroughs,he invented a new weapon, the sigma function. All this function does isit takes all the divisors of a number, including thenumber itself and adds them up. So take any number, saysix, sum up all its divisors and you get 12, which is twicethe number we started with. And this will be truefor all perfect numbers. The Sigma function of a perfect number will always give twice the number itself because the sigma functionincludes the number as one of its divisors. Now this may seem like a small change, but it ends up being extremely powerful. So let's look at a few examples. Take a prime number like seven. Now, because it's prime, you can't rearrange it into a rectangle, therefore the only divisorsare one and the prime itself. So Sigma seven is 1 plus7, which is equal to 8. Now, to keep things easier to follow, we'll just stick to the numbers. But what if instead ofseven, you had seven cubed? Well, again, the sum of thedivisors is really simple. It's just 1 plus 7 plus7 squared plus 7 cubed. Now let's use it on adifferent number, say 20. The sum of its divisorsis 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 5 plus 10 plus 20, which equals 42. But you can also write this as 1 plus 2 plus 4 times 1 plus 5. And this is what really makes the sigma function so powerful. If you have a number thatis made up of other numbers that don't share factors with each other, then you can split up the sigma function into the sigma functionsof the prime powers that make it up. So sigma of 2 squared times sigma 5 is equal to sigma 20. And since any number canbe written as the product of prime powers, you cansplit up the sigma function of any composite numberinto the sigma functions of its prime powers. With his new function in hand, Euler achieved his second breakthrough and did what Descartes couldn't. He proved that every evenperfect number has Euclid's form. This Euclid-Euler theoremsolved a 1600-year-old problem and proved Nicomachus's fourth conjecture. Math historian William Dunham called it the greatest mathematicalcollaboration in history. But Euler wasn't finished yet. He also wanted to solve theproblem of odd perfect numbers. So for his third breakthrough, he set out to prove Descartes other statement that every odd perfect numbermust have a specific form. Because if an odd perfectnumber does exist, you know two things first n is odd. And second sigma of n equals 2n. Now any number n, youcan write as a product of different prime numbers and each prime can be to some power. So let's take that and putit into Euler sigma function. So you get sigma of n equalssigma of all of those primes to their powers, which equals 2n. But since all of these factors are primes, you can actually split up thesigma function into the sigmas of the individual prime powers. Now one thing to notice is that if you have a primenumber raised to an odd power, for example seven to the power of 1, then the sigma function will be even because 1 plus 7 equals 8, you'll always get an even number because odd plus odd is even if the prime number is instead raised to an even power like seven squared, then the sigma functionreturns an odd number. Sigma of 7 squared equals1 plus 7 plus 7 squared, which equals 57. Because odd plus odd plus odd equals odd. So if you have the sigmafunction of an odd prime raised to an odd power, it willgive an even number. If instead it's raised to an even power, you get an odd number. And this is where Euler'sgenius insight comes in because here on the rightside you've got 2 times n where n is an odd perfectnumber, and 2 is even. Well, what that means is that on the left side theremust only be one even number because if there were two even numbers, you could factor out four. But that means you should also be able to factor out four on theright side, which you can't because n is odd and there'sonly a single 2 here. So only one of these sigmashere can give an even number, which means that thereis exactly one prime that is to an odd power and all the others mustbe to an even power just as Descartes had predicted. Now, Euler refined the form a bit more and showed that an oddperfect number must satisfy this condition, but evenEuler couldn't prove whether they existed or not. He wrote \"Whether thereare any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question.\" For the next 150 years very little progress was made and no new perfectnumbers were discovered. English mathematician Peter Barlow wrote that Euler eighth perfectnumber \"Is the greatest that ever will be discovered for as they are merelycurious without being useful, it is not likely that anyperson will ever attempt to find one beyond it.\" But Barlow was wrong. Mathematicians kept pursuingthese elusive perfect numbers and most started with Mersenne'slist of proposed primes. The next on his listwas 2 to the 67 minus 1. So far, Mersenne haddone an excellent job. He had included Euler'seighth perfect number while avoiding others like 29 that turned out not tolead to a perfect number, but 230 years afterMersenne published his list, Edouard Lucas proved that 2 tothe 67 minus 1 was not prime, although he was unableto find its factors. 27 years later, FrankNelson Cole gave a talk to the American mathematicalsociety without saying a word, he walked to one side of the blackboard and wrote down 2 to the 67 minus 1 equals 147,573,952,589,676,412,927. He then walked to the otherside of the blackboard and multiplied 193,707,721 times 761,838,257,287 giving the same answer. He sat down without saying a word and the audience erupted in applause. He later admitted it took him three years working on Sundays to solve this. A modern computer could solvethis in less than a second. From 500 BC until 1952 people had discoveredjust 12 Mersenne primes and therefore only 12 perfect numbers. The main difficulty was checking whether large Mersenne numberswere actually prime. But in 1952, American mathematicianRaphael Robinson wrote a computer program to perform this task and he ran it on the fastestcomputer at the time, the SWAC. Within 10 months, he foundthe next five Mersenne primes and so corresponding perfect numbers. And over the next 50 years, new Mersenne primes werediscovered in rapid succession, all using computers. The largest Mersenneprime at the end of 1952 was 2 to the power of 2,281 minus 1, which is 687 digits long. By the end of 1994, thelargest Mersenne prime was 2 to the power of 859,433 minus 1, which is 258,716 digits long. Since these numbers weregetting so astronomically large, the task of findingnumerous end primes became more and more difficulteven for supercomputers. So in 1996, computer scientist George Woltman launched the Great Internet MersennePrime Search or GIMPS. GIMPS distributes thework over many computers allowing anyone to volunteertheir computer power to help search for Mersenne primes. The project has beenhighly successful so far, having discovered 17 new Mersenne primes, 15 of which were the largestknown primes at that time. And the best part, ifyour computer discovers a new Mersenne prime, you'll be listed as its discoverer, adding yourself to a list that includes some of the bestmathematicians of all time. There's even a $250,000 prize for the first billion-digit prime. In 2017 Church Deacon John Pace discovered the 50th Mersenne Prime by using GIMPS. The number 2 to the 77,232,917 minus 1 is more than 23 million digits long, and it was also the largestknown prime at the time. To celebrate this achievement the Japanese publishing house, Nanairosha published this book, \"The Largest Prime number of 2017.\" And all it is is that number spreadover 719 glorious pages. It's wild. The size of this font is so tiny. The book quickly rose to thenumber one spot on Amazon and sold out in four days. A year later, the 51stMersenne Prime was discovered. It's 2 to the 82,589,933 minus 1, and this number has24,000,860 2048 digits. But there's something Ienjoy about the absurdity, like there is knowledge in here, but it's not the kind of knowledge that anyone's ever gonnaread out of a book. But in some way it's nice that there's this physical artifact that like has the number, if ever we lost all the prime numbers. You know, someone could find this book be like, here's the big one. As of today, this is stillthe largest known prime. And since numbers of thisform grow so rapidly, the largest Mersenne Prime is almost always the largest known prime. Computers have been incredibly successful at finding new Mersenne primes and their corresponding perfect numbers, but we've still only found 51 so far. So you might suspect that there are only a finite number of them, which would mean thatNicomachus's fifth conjecture would be false, that there aren't infinitelymany perfect numbers, but that might not be the case. The Lenstra and PomeranceWagstaff conjecture predicts how many Mersenne primes should appear based on how large P is. Now this is the actual data the conjecture performs remarkably well. But more importantly, it predicts that there are infinitelymany Mersenne primes and so infinitely manyeven perfect numbers. The Mersenne primes arejust so large and rare that they take a lot of timeand computer resources to find. But a conjecture is not a proof. And up until this day, this problem shares the title of oldestunsolved problem in math with the other open problem. Do any odd perfect numbers exist? The easiest way to solve this problem is by finding an example. So maybe we could justcheck different odd numbers and see if one of them is perfect. That's exactly whatresearchers tried in 1991. By using a smart algorithmcalled a factor chain, they were able to show thatif an odd perfect number does exist, it must be larger than 10 to the power of 300. 21 years later, PascalOchem and Michael Rao raised that lower bound to 10 to the 1,500 with recent progresspushing that number up to 10 to the 2,200. With numbers that large, it's unlikely that a computerwill find one anytime soon. So we'll need to get smart. What would a proof look like? Like how could we actually prove this? I think the main ideathat people have been trying to approach this problemwith is coming up with more and more conditions odd perfect numbers have tosatisfy, it's called this web of conditions where it hasto have 10 prime factors now that we know and maybe thousands of non distinct prime factors and has to be bigger than 10 to the 3000. And it has to do allthese different things and we hope that eventuallythere's just so many conditions that can strain the numbersso much that they can't exist. Since Euler, mathematicianshave kept adding new conditions to this web. But so far it hasn't worked. But there might be another path. When Descartes was lookingfor odd perfect numbers, he came across 198,585,576,189, which you can factor as3 squared times 7 squared times 11 squared times13 squared times 22021. Put this into Euler sigma function and you find it is equal totwo times the original number. In other words, it is perfect. That is if 22021 were prime, but it's not because it is equal to19 squared times 61. And filling that in showsthat it is not perfect. Numbers like this that are very close to being odd perfectnumbers are called spoofs. Spoofs are a larger group of numbers. So odd perfect numbers shareall properties of spoofs and then a few extra ones. And the goal is to findproperties of spoofs that ultimately prevent themfrom being odd perfect numbers. For example, one condition of odd perfect numbers is thatthey can't be divided by 105. So if you find that spoofsmust be divisible by 105, then this would prove that odd perfect numbers can't exist. In 2022 Pace Nielsen and a team at BYU found 21 spoof numbersincluding Descartes number, and while they discoveredsome new properties of spoofs, they didn't find any thatrule out odd, perfect numbers. So how large would an oddperfect number have to be? They don't exist. You don't think oddperfect numbers exist? No, they don't exist. I wish they did. That'd be really cool if if there was just this one gigantic odd, perfectnumber out in the universe. They don't exist. No. How are you convincedthat they don't exist? There is somethingcalled a heuristic argument where it's not a proof. So if we had a proof, we'd be done. It's just an argument from, okay, we think primes occurthis often of this type. And you put that those piecesof information together and you think, okay, on average how many numbers should be perfect. This argument, which wasmade by Carl Pomerance predicts that between 10 to the 2,200 and infinity, there are no more than 10 to the negative 540 perfect numbers of the form N equals pm squared With odd perfect numbers the heuristic says weshouldn't expect any. We've searched highenough now that we think we have enough evidence theyshouldn't exist anymore. My understanding isthis heuristic argument. It also predicts that there are no largeperfect numbers even or odd. So... That's true. So there's a downside. Yeah, there's a downside because it says there shouldn't be large, even perfect numbers andwe actually expect there to be infinitely many. And so, okay, so... why do I believe theheuristic in this case and not this case? You're right. Am I being hypocritical about that? There are other aspects you can add on to the heuristic and make it stronger. Let me put it that way. But you're right, it's not a proof. For now this is still theoldest unsolved problem in math. Euler was right when hesaid whether there are any odd perfect numbers isa most difficult question. So are there anyapplications of this problem? I can say no. Now, many people may think that if there are noapplications to the real world, then there's no point studying it. Why should anyone care aboutsome old unsolved problem? But I think that's the wrong approach. For more than 2000 years, number theory had noreal world applications. It was just mathematiciansfollowing their curiosity and solving problems theyfound interesting proving one result after another and building a foundationof useless mathematics. But then in the 20th century, we realized that we could take this foundation and base our cryptography on it. This is what protectseverything from text messages to government secrets. Whenever you have a group of people put theirminds towards a problem, something good's gonna come out of it. If it's only, if it'sonly at the beginning, this doesn't work. Okay, well, as Edisonsaid, I learned 999 ways of not making a light bulb. Eventually I got a good way to do it. It's the same with math. You have a problem and you throw your mindat it and others do too. And you come up with new ideas and eventually somethinggood comes from that process. Einstein's general relativity was built on non-Euclidean geometries,geometries that were developed as intellectual curiositieswithout foresight of how they would one day change the way we understand the universe. How many people do you thinkare working on the problem of perfect numbers right now? I'd guess around 10 people currently have papers in the area, 10 to 15. If you're a high schoolerand you just love mathematics and you think, I want aproblem to think about, this one's a great problem to think about. And you can make progress.You can figure out new things. Yeah, don't be scared. Hundreds of people havethought about this problem for thousands of years. What can I do? You can do something. Why should you do math if you don't know that it will lead anywhere? Well, because doing themath is the only way to know for sure. You can't tell in advancewhat the outcome will be. Like this problem mightturn out to be a dud. We might solve it and it mightnot mean anything to anyone, or it could turn out tobe remarkably helpful.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: Ingenuity helicopter mission on Mars"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On the surface of Mars, 297 million kilometers away is Ingenuity, a tiny 680 gram helicopter. It's made from off-the-shelf parts you'd find at home. It's got bits from an Android smartphone, batteries from a cordless drill, and to everyone's surprise, it's been performing well so far. But something is wrong. See, the Martian winter is coming. At night, temperatures plummet to a frigid negative 85 degrees celsius. As Mars gets further away from the sun, the temperature keeps dropping, and it kicks up more and more violent dust. The sun is blotted from the sky. On her 427th day on Mars, they try to reach her, just like the day before, but they get no response. They try again, nothing. Back on Earth the team gathers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. All the signs point to Ingenuity being dead. But there is still one thing, one final trick that can try to reestablish a connection. The first drone that's gonna fly on another planet. Six years ago, I visited JPL and saw Ingenuity before she left for Mars. At the time, NASA didn't really believe much in her mission. As Kenneth Farley, the project scientist of the Mars 2020 Perseverance mission said, I've personally been opposed to it... Spending 30 days working on a technology demonstration does not further the goals directly from the science point of view. In short, they thought it was a waste of time. Most projects to Mars get billions of dollars. Ingenuity got only 80 million, which is less than the budget of the movie The Martian. But this scrappy team of scientists were working to prove a crazy concept. And against the odds, they made it to Mars. On February 18th, 2021, the Perseverance Rover survives entry and lands on the Martian surface. Attached underneath is Ingenuity. This marks Sol Zero, her first day on Mars. They sever the umbilical cord and Ingenuity, affectionately known as Ginny by some on the team, prepares herself. Her mission is simple. Prove that flight on the red planet is possible. But with an atmosphere just 1% that of Earth, flying is really difficult. She must be ultra light, and her blades must spin at over 2,400 rotations per minute to generate enough lift. It's a design that no one is really sure about. For two months, they rigorously check her systems, running up the engine, testing navigation, and her control computer. Then, on Sol 58, they finally think they're ready. The blades spin up. And... she takes off, only 120 years after the Wright brothers on Earth. Humanity flies on another planet. Within days, they fly again, and then again, and again. In just one month, they complete five flights. So the mission has been accomplished. We were a tech demo, right, meaning a specified, narrow, 30-sol mission. Um, get in, get out, we're done, right? We go to a bar and party and that should be the end of it. But with success, comes new expectations. NASA tells them to keep going. Ingenuity's new mission is to assist Perseverance in the search for evidence of ancient life on Mars. So she will scout ahead, gathering data in areas too risky or costly for the rover to explore. For the team, this is great news, but it's also a problem. There was no guarantee, you know, after flight five, we may be dead by flight seven, right? We may be dead by flight 10. We were kind of thrown into the deep end of the pool. We had no processes or no plans developed for such a thing. Until now, every flight had been carefully planned. They've all started from an area selected and analyzed by both satellites and the Perseverance Rover itself. These flights were tested hundreds of times in JPL's wind tunnel, and tens of thousands of times in simulation. But now that they have to keep up with the rover, they're flying into the unknown. Now, flying the helicopter isn't easy. At its closest, Mars is 56 million kilometers from Earth. Which means, there's at least a six minute round trip communications time delay, which is way longer than Ingenuity's two minute maximum flight time. So she has to fly autonomously. So what happens is the pilot programs in a route, and Ginny does the rest. But to start, JPL first needs to know exactly where she's located. You might think that they would use GPS, but for GPS to work on earth, you need at least 24 satellites for full coverage. And around Mars, there are only seven satellites total, so Ingenuity can't use this method. So instead what she does is far simpler. We have two cameras, a forward facing 13 megapixel camera, and then the one pointing down is the one that we use to navigate. The navigation camera takes 30 black and white images per second. Ingenuity's computer analyzes the image and identifies features on the surface. You can think of it sort of like an optical mouse. Like your optical mouse is on the mouse pad. It doesn't know where on the mouse pad it is, but when you move to the right, it knows you moved to the right. Because what it's doing is it's looking at features on the surface of the mouse pad and watching them move under its field of view. So Ingenuity is essentially doing the same thing. It's looking at the surface, it's picking out features like rocks and other things, and between camera images it says, oh, this rock moved this way, this thing over here moved this way, and from that you can compute a transform, to say my helicopter was here and now it's here relative to this image. Now this sounds good, but the method isn't 100% reliable. On Flight 6, the first time she leaves her testing area, Ingenuity detects an error. 54 seconds into the flight, she starts wobbling wildly, tilting 20 degrees at a time. Her emergency alarms blare. We had black and white image, black and white image, black and white image, and we had a colored image come very closely to where that black and white image occurred in time. This color camera was added late in development, leaving little time for testing. And during this flight, one of the images arrives at the exact same moment as a black and white image. The system doesn't know what to do, so it drops the black and white image. This makes every following image one step behind. This means Ingenuity's cameras are giving her outdated information. So even when she's in the right spot, the computer thinks she's lagging behind and pushes her forward. So she overshoots, tilts too far, and then has to overcorrect in the other direction. This cycle repeats, making her wobble worse in a positive feedback loop. Now that is a problem, but it isn't fatal. The desyncing issue was like one camera frame off. If it had been more than that, I think you can imagine. imagine that it might have death spiraled. Instead, Ginny detects the problem and is able to emergency land before it gets too ugly. While safely on the ground, JPL discovers the error and quickly corrects it with a software patch. It's a close call, but they recover. Over the next dozen flights, they keep up with the rover and support the mission. That is, until Flight 19. We were about to fly that 19th flight, and I got a phone call the afternoon before, basically saying there's a dust storm brewing near Jezero crater. So we quickly canceled the flight and said well we're just going to hunker down and see what happens. They brace for impact. It lasts six days, with winds gusting up to 20 meters per second. That first dust storm in the middle of fall, the first Martian year that we were on the surface, it clobbered us. But... they make it through. Nervously, they try to make contact, and she survived. She hasn't died or toppled over, but now they have a new problem. Dust. Dust on Mars is no joke. I mean, for Ginny, there are two big problems. First, dust is covering her solar panels, reducing power by 18%. And second, it's clogging her mechanical components. We went to go fly, and when we went to wiggle the servos, they were actually stuck. They were kind of jammed from the dust. So that aborted the first attempt at flight 19. Now JPL had anticipated both of these problems, but they hadn't had the time or budget to fix them. So for the first, they just have to accept that they have reduced solar power and they adjust their flight durations accordingly. For the second, they find a workaround by repeatedly wiggling the servos until the joints clear. So she's able to keep flying, albeit wounded, and survival isn't getting any easier. See, every Martian night, the temperature drops precipitously. My friend Alex from the channel Astrum describes it well. With less atmosphere, Mars became far worse at retaining heat. When the surface starts to cool, there is no air to catch the escaping warmth. It is at the point where, if you were to stand on the planet's equator during its warmest time of the day, your feet might feel 23\u00b0C, while at your head, it would be 0\u00b0C. This means between day and night, Mars has some intense temperature swings. Temperatures there now range from highs of around 27\u00b0C down to a freezing minus 133\u00b0C at night. If you want to learn more about how this leads to entire planet-covering dust storms, Astrum has a whole video on the Martian climate. So these massive shifts in temperature are happening all the time. But as Ginny's mission progresses, Mars gets farther away from the Sun and enters the Martian winter. So it gets even colder at night, which is a problem. Many of Ingenuity's key electrical components are hand-soldered. And big temperature swings cause expansion and contraction of this metal, and so that can eventually break these connections. Also, inside the batteries, a liquid electrolyte solution allows lithium ions to move between the cathode and anode during charging and discharging. But if this solution freezes, JPL fears that the whole thing will stop working entirely. So what they do is keep all the components sensitive to the cold inside a warm box, which has resistance heaters that run during the night. You might spend 25 or 30% of your battery flying and the other 60 to 75% is all just staying warm at night. The problem is, the colder it gets, the harder the heaters have to work. And if they can't keep up, and the batteries cool too much, they become less efficient. So they supply even less power to the heaters. Performance can continue to degrade in a vicious death spiral. On the morning of May 3rd, the team at JPL goes about a normal day. They check the data from the previous downlink? Nothing. They try pinging ingenuity? Still nothing. Have they finally lost her? Did we just lose our $70 million helicopter on Mars? Is this the end of the mission? We thought this was it. So let's just make sure, before we close the door on ingenuity, we've thought of everything. Just keep working through it. They run through all the possible problems until they narrow it down to just one. The way she was designed, Ginny has an alarm clock that wakes her up. It stays awake for 15 minutes. If it doesn't hear anything after 15 minutes, it goes back to sleep, and it doesn't wake up until the next alarm. Their hypothesis is this: if the lack of sunlight forced Jenny to fully deplete her batteries, then during the night her heaters would have stopped and she would have powered off completely. When the sun rises, as long as her essential components still function, she may recharge enough to wake up. Only now her clock will have reset. So they run the calculations. If she's still alive based on when the sun comes up, she should be waking up at 11:45 a.m. Martian time. That is not the time they had been trying. So they change their search window and start calling out to Ginny around when they expect her to power up. They send out ping after ping until finally... she's alive! They check to see whether everything is still working. And despite the components in her warm box only being rated to negative 45 degrees, they survive being completely frozen. Well, all except for one. The inclinometer is dead. The inclinometer is what lets Ingenuity know her physical orientation in 3D space before flight. And that is pretty essential for getting the right heading. You can imagine if you're off in heading by 10 degrees, you could fly into a mountain. Without the inclinometer, there is no way for her to fly. So at first, the whole team is stumped, but then they have an idea because Ingenuity is made of phone parts, literally parts from phones people carry around every day. Her processor is from a Samsung Galaxy S5, and some of her sensors are from a Google Pixel 3. And these phones can do a lot of the things that an inclinometer can do. Inside every smartphone are at least three little micro-electromechanical systems aligned perpendicular to each other, like x, y, z. At their core is a small mass suspended by flexible arms. They work like springs and follow Hooke's law, F = -kx, where force is proportional to displacement. The mass also follows Newton's second law, F = ma. If you combine these equations, you get a = -kx/m. which links acceleration and displacement. Surrounding the mass are fixed arms. When a voltage is applied to the mass and arms, they form a capacitor, where epsilon and A stay constant, but as the mass moves, the distance between them changes with x. This alters the capacitance, which becomes more noticeable with multiple plates, hence why they have so many little arms. By measuring capacitance, you can determine displacement. And since displacement is proportional to acceleration, changes in capacitance allow us to measure acceleration. That's why these devices are called accelerometers, and by integrating acceleration over time, you can work out velocity and then position. This is how motion tracking works for screen rotation, gaming controls, and step counting. If you add gyroscopes, you get an inertial measurement unit, or IMU, and Ingenuity has the same IMU as the Google Pixel 3. So the team at JPL had an idea. They could reprogram the computer to use the IMU to replace the inclinometer. The inclinometer is really just accelerometers that allows us to tell the initial altitude of the vehicle in roll and pitch. And the IMU also has accelerometers, so in principle it gives you the same information. So from the clutches of failure, they get her running again. We got lucky in that the one instrument we could afford to lose was the one that died. But the IMU isn't space-grade. In fact, none of these off-the-shelf parts are, which means they're vulnerable to cosmic rays. On Mars, the thin atmosphere doesn't just make it harder to fly. It also means cosmic rays reach the surface more easily, and a single cosmic ray can strike a computer register and flip a bit inside the computer, which can lead to some strange behavior. It even happens here on Earth. It once added 4,096 unaccounted votes to a candidate in a Belgian election. Now on a Martian helicopter, flipping the wrong bit at the wrong time could mean losing control and crashing. So why doesn't that happen? If you'd asked somebody 10 years ago can you fly just the latest cell phone processor they'd be like no it'll last like two days and you'll be dead right It turns out that cosmic ray bit flips are not as big a deal as NASA thought. The off-the-shelf components hold up way better than they expected. And this is an important finding. Rather than going through all of the development cost of building up a processor from scratch to be radiation tolerant, our finding is you get a lot better bang for your buck by just going and basically buying batches of different processors and just qualling them. That means throw them through a radiation test campaign, look at the failure rates, figuring out, hey, this guy, we don't know why, but for whatever reason, this processor over here is great. It holds up, so we'll fly that. Now, using these surprisingly robust off-the-shelf parts, they survive the rest of the winter, but they're only barely able to stay within the communication range of the rover. -Springtime came. -Yeah. -The birds were chirping on the... -Talk about spring optimism, right? Like coming out of winter. With the increased sunlight, they can now fully recharge and return to their scientific mission. Over the next 41 flights, they image craters Perseverance can't make it to. They capture stunning images of the Martian horizon from above. they conduct daring aerodynamic tests and they begin to push the limits. They want to fly faster, but the faster they go, the quicker features move across the camera's field of view. And the vision navigation system just can't keep up with that. So JPL comes up with a solution. They fly higher. Then they can expand the field of view, which means features will move more slowly through frame. So, from an initial goal of a 10 meter altitude, they go up to 24 meters, and as a result, they're able to go from flying at 2 meters per second all the way up to 10 meters per second. Speed records, distance records, altitude records, just everything we could think of to push that flight envelope on Ingenuity, really make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of having a helicopter on Mars. Everything is going swimmingly. Ginny and Perseverance have made it all the way to Nuretva Vallis, a river delta in Jezero Crater. But on Flight 71, there's a new problem, and it's worse than any of the ones that came before. Now, Ingenuity's only scientific payload is a camera, so she's taking hundreds of photos a day and sending them to JPL. And she's not alone. Perseverance does the same, including this selfie with Ingenuity. Honestly, they're the most chronically online duo on Mars. We always know exactly where they are, what they're up to, and they're constantly sharing photos. But really, how different is that from us? I mean, we spend most of our lives online, constantly sharing data. Except in our case, that data doesn't just sit in a NASA archive. It gets bought, sold, and used in ways we're not always aware of.

I want to thank Incogni for sponsoring this part of the video. And now back to Ingenuity. So we just had this one final thing to do. We needed to cross this sand dune and make it to Bright Angel to rendezvous with the rover. So on 71, we basically went up. We were flying. And then after about 10 seconds of flying with degraded navigation, we went into an emergency landing mode and sort of came down hard. They hailed Ginny and luckily she's still alive. In the error code they discover the problem. As she was flying over the dunes there just weren't enough rocks or landmarks for her camera to identify and without those references she quickly lost track of her position and had to make an emergency landing. It's similar to the camera issue from flight 6 but this time there's no software fix. They check for structural damage but suprisingly everything is still intact. So they attempt another flight, this time going straight up to scan the surroundings and then coming straight back down. Simple. We popped up, took pictures, and then on the way back down, we hit the same problems we did on 71. Only this time, it's fatal. Perseverance drives over and captures this image of her crash site. When we saw the blades broken, when we saw that first image after flight 72, that was heart wrenching. It was like, no, there's no way this mission can continue. That was very depressing. So why? Because 71 was also a crash landing for the same reasons. It was, you know, the NASA system was confused and drove us into the ground, but we came out of that apparently unscathed, and yet on 72, we self-destructed. This is the first air crash investigation on another planet, right? Yeah, that's right. First aircraft on another planet and then the first air crash investigation kind of go hand in hand. At the crash site, they find Ingenuity's blades scattered, but not in the way they expect. We noticed something interesting, which was there was no blade strike spot. Blades spinning this fast, when they hit the ground, right, they're going to create a spray. There's going to be a pattern, probably even visible from orbit, and we didn't see anything like that. So if the blades didn't strike the ground, then what happened? So this is an actual prototype blade from the development phase. This is essentially identical to the blades on Ingenuity. It's a carbon fiber composite with a foam core. It's incredibly light, if you want to feel it. Yeah.- Woah! That's actually great. That's like at least a quarter of what I expected just looking at it. It doesn't feel physical. So why did they break? Well, as the blades spin, the tips of the blades trace out a circle, which you can think of like a hula hoop. If there's a force up on the near side, you might expect the rotor to tilt immediately in this direction. But that is not actually what happens. See, the blade isn't stationary, it's moving really fast. So when you apply this force, it actually only moves after that point. So the maximum displacement occurs 90 degrees later. So, even though we push up on the near side, the blades tilt up on the right and down on the left. This effect is called precession, and it's the same principle that explains this spinning bike wheel demonstration. Now, Ingenuity has a second set of blades that are moving in the opposite direction. Which means that, when a force is applied, each set of blades experiences precession in the opposite direction. For the helicopter overall, these torques cancel out, but each individual blade still flexes because of that precession torque. That results in a stress concentration right about here where that final reinforcement tapers off. And so if you had a procession-based failure, you'd expect it to fail right here. And sure enough, that's exactly where you see it in the pictures. You can see sort of this jaggy place where the blade tip just got ripped off. So that is what happened on Flight 72. As Ginny came down hard, she hit a dune at an angle. The force was transmitted up through the body of the helicopter, and this created a procession torque that bent the rotors, and they snapped right where the reinforcement tapers down. This thing came down hard. It didn't destroy the landing gear. It didn't break the avionics. It didn't kill the servos. The swash plates are all fine. They're all intact. It's the rotors. That's the weak link. So that is the first thing they're changing on the next generation of Mars helicopter, which is called Chopper. You had a chance to hold the Ingenuity blade. This is the next-gen baby blade. It looks fairly similar with a couple of key differences. They reinforced the blades to withstand the torques caused by hard landings. Now they also have six rotors instead of two, which means Chopper can hold a lot, even carrying a scientific payload of its own. We've developed now a very lightweight radio that can communicate directly to orbit. Woah. So we're a free bird when it comes to exploring the planet now.-That's huge, that's huge! You were sort of trying to trail perseverance, right, and now you can go anywhere. Yep, we're our own spacecraft. In this blue box, you can shove about five kilograms of science payload and bring it anywhere on the planet on Mars. You can fly three kilometers per sol in a matter of minutes. That's really generated a lot of excitement in the science community. So this is a fifth scale model of Chopper. It's really two systems. So this is our Chopper platform, right? This is what's going to go on and explore the entire surface of Mars one day. That's the point of the concept. But underneath, is a mid-air helicopter delivery platform. See, Mars rovers all need complex sky cranes to land, but a helicopter is different. It just needs a platform to take off from. So the idea is we come down through the atmosphere, we have this jet pack that we need to slow us down to get us down to a regime that is controllable so that we can take off from that platform midair and land under our own power. For this, it needs rockets. 3, 2, 1... Awesome! You're envisioning like a future of aviation all over Mars as a primary explorative. In my mind, it's absolutely going to happen in just a matter of time. There will be fleets flying, you know, throughout Mars. There will be airports on Mars one day, and we'll have aircraft the size of Chopper, more aircraft the size of Ingenuity, and even bigger than Chopper. NASA is thinking big thanks to Ingenuity, a project they once doubted. Because Ginny showed what is possible. In 1890, if you had said, I'm gonna fly, it's like, okay, that kooky guy in his garage, he thinks he can fly, he's gonna kill himself, right? After the Wright brothers, it's like, oh, okay, yeah, this is the thing that we're gonna do. And so that's the change in mentality that's occurred because of engineering. That's why, still sitting there on the surface of Mars, attached to the underside of Ingenuity is a tiny scrap, one square centimeter of muslin fabric. It was taken from the lower left wing of the first airplane, the right flyer. From the first flight on Earth, to the first flight on another planet. From Ingenuity's grave on Mars, her spirit lives on. Except... she isn't quite dead yet. She's acting as a weather station now, capturing photos every day, capturing temperature measurements every day, something no one would have ever predicted before flight 72 that if things don't go well, we just still have a functioning spacecraft. So she's a tank. The team couldn't be more proud of what Ingenuity's accomplished. Thanks for watching."}]}

All of it can be replacedby this single rule. It feels like we'reapproaching spooky territory. We're approaching spooky territory. I hear you and I agree. [Derek] It may in factexplain the behavior of life itself. I think I'm stuck in someclassical mindset where, to me, the local picture, the differential equation way of thinking about the universe, that that's really what's going on. But I fear that I haveit exactly backwards. And it all starts with a simple problem. If you wanna slide a massfrom point A to point B, what shape of ramp willget it there the fastest? This is known as theproblem of fastest descent. You know, common sense, you might say take the shortest path. Straight line from A to B. [Derek] But if youbend the ramp down a bit at the beginning, well, the mass acceleratesto a higher speed earlier. So even though ittravels slightly farther, it travels faster andbeats the straight ramp. So the question is, what shapeprovides the perfect balance of acceleration and path length to minimize travel time? According to Galileo, itwas the arc of a circle. He showed that this isfaster than any polygon. But is it the fastest? Nearly 60 years later, in June of 1696, Johann Bernoulli set thisproblem as a challenge to the best mathematicians in the world. Mainly because he's a big show off and he wants to show thathe's better than all of them. [Derek] He gave everyone six months to come up with solutions, but none were submitted. So Gottfried Leibniz, afriend of Bernoulli's, persuaded him to extend the deadline to give foreigners a chance. And I think Newton wasprobably the intended target because everybody thoughtof him as the best, and so Johann would've wanted to show that he was better than Newton. He was no longer a really activemathematician or physicist. He was working as the warden of the Mint, like a big high government position. [Derek] And on the29th of January, 1697, Newton returned homeafter a long day at work to find Bernoulli's challenge in the mail. Irritated, he wrote, \"I do not love to be dunnedand teased by foreigners about mathematical things.\" But the problem was too enticing, so Newton spent the restof the day and night on it, and by 4:00 a.m. he hadcome up with a solution, something that took Bernoulli two weeks. Newton submitted his solution to the journal Philosophical Transactions. He sent his solutionthere but didn't sign it. And Johann Bernoulli,after seeing the solution, is alleged to have said, \"I recognize the lion by his claw.\" You know, that, \"Okay, youdon't need to sign it, Newton, I can tell who you are. Who else could give such a solution?\" [Derek] And while overallNewton dominated Bernoulli, in this instance, Bernoulli's solutionactually out-shone Newton's. I could see why Johann Bernoulli wanted to challenge everybody, because he came up with a really clever, I would say like a trulycreative, beautiful solution. To do it, he took inspiration from a problem faced byancient philosophers. How does light travelfrom one place to another? This was contemplatedby Hero of Alexandria in the 1st century AD. He realized that in asingle medium, like air, light always follows the shortest path. A consequence is that whenlight reflects, say, off a lake, the angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection. Any other path betweenthe start and end points would be longer. But when light goes fromone medium into another, like from air into water, it bends in a peculiar way. It refracts and it doesn'tfollow the shortest path. If you've ever dropped something at the bottom of a swimming pool and you look for it through the water, if you put your hand in there, it's not necessarily where you think it is because the light has bentaway from the flat surface. So what is the guiding principle here? Well, over the next 1,600years people slowly figured out that the sine of the angle of incidence divided by the sine ofthe angle of refraction is equal to a constant, n, which depends on thenature of the two media. This came to be known as Snell's Law. But no one knew why it worked. That is, until 1657. So another great mathematician enters our story at this point. This is Pierre Fermat. By day he was a judge, but at night he'd come home and hang out with his wife and kids and then do what he really loved the most, which was work on math for fun. And he mostly worked in pure math but at one point he gotinterested in the question of, why does light obey thisprinciple of refraction? [Derek] And he thoughtmaybe Hero of Alexandria was on the right track, but it's not distancethat is being minimized, but rather time. But to see if this was true for refraction would be difficult. He would have to work out every possible path light could take by varying the point whereit intersects the boundary and compute the time for each, and then show that light takes the path for which the total traveltime is the shortest. He doesn't know how to solve it and he worries that it'sgonna come out complicated even if he could solve it, so he's not gonna do it. I think it's 'cause hewasn't super interested in physics, actually. But anyway, years go by, he gets interested in it five years later and tries to solve it, and then he does solve it and he shows that Snell'sLaw actually pops out as the minimizing pathfor light, you know, under these conditionsof moving from one medium with one speed of lightto another with another. [Derek] And that constant, n, well, that's just equalto the speed of light in the first medium divided by the speed oflight in the second medium, which allows us to rewriteSnell's Law like this. And he says this thing, I just wanna read you alittle quote 'cause I love it. He says that this is\"the most extraordinary, the most unforeseen, and the happiest calculation\" of his life. See, it's good to do physics. (both laugh) If you use that principle of least time, you can explain everythingthat was known about light at the time of Fermat. It's the first time, as far as I know, that anyone shows that nature obeys an optimization principle, that nature does the best possible thing. In this case, that light takesthe shortest possible time. [Derek] Now, Bernoulli knew about Fermat's principle of least time, and he thought he coulduse it to solve the problem of fastest descent. He converted the problemfrom a mechanics problem about a particle sliding down a chute to a problem about optics. [Derek] Instead of a massthat's accelerated by gravity, he imagined a ray of lightthat would go faster and faster as it went into layers ofless and less dense media. And if you make thelayers thinner and thinner where Snell's Law isobeyed at each interface, you eventually get a continuous curve. Now the question is, how should the speed of light change from one layer to the next so that it accuratelymodels a falling object? [Steven] You could try tosolve the problem by thinking, if the particle has to fall from A to B, it's gonna be picking up kinetic energy, it's going faster and fasteras it slides down the chute and it's converting theloss in potential energy into this kinetic energy. If you write down theconservation of energy for that relationship, you find that the velocitythat the particle achieves at any time, having fallen a distance, let's say y, its velocity squared willbe proportional to y, the height from the top. So velocity goes likethe square root of y. And that'd be sort of like saying imagine light moving in a way where, instead of a constant speed of light, the speed of light is proportional to the distance from the top. [Derek] Now let's zoom inand look at a single interface. We can plug in our expression for the speed of light in each layer into Snell's Law. Then find that the sine of the first angle divided by the square rootof y for the first layer is equal to the sine of the second angle divided by the square rootof y for the second layer. And now here's the key insight. Snell's Law also holds for the next layer, and there the ingoingangle is simply theta 2. So this is also equal tothe sine of the third angle divided by the square root of y3. And the same goes for the nextlayer and the next and so on. In other words, this ratio must be equal tosome constant, call it k. And this equation, the story goes, Bernoulli immediately recognized as the equation of a cycloid. That is the path traced out by a point attached to the rim of a rolling wheel. This is also known asa brachistochrone curve from the Greek for shortest time. [Steven] And so the astonishing solution is that the fastest way to get from A to B is to follow an arc of a cycloid. Not a circle, a shape called a cycloid. Now, this curve also hasanother surprising property. No matter where I release the mass from, it always reaches theend at the same time. For this reason, it's also known as the tautochrone curve, from the Greek for same time. Upon finding this solution, Bernoulli wrote, \"In this wayI have solved at one stroke two important problems, an optical and a mechanical one, and have achieved more thanI demanded from others. I have shown that the two problems taken from entirely separatefields of mathematics have the same character.\" Little did Bernoulli know hewas onto something much bigger. Around 40 years later, one of his students,Pierre Louis de Maupertuis, also studied the behaviorof light and particles, and he noticed that there are cases where the two behave very similarly. This made him think, what if Fermat's principle of least time wasn't the most fundamental? I mean, why should naturecare about minimizing time? Maybe there is a more foundationalquantity being minimized, one that doesn't only governlight, but also particles. So, in the 1740s, heproposed a new quantity, which he called the action. It is mass times velocity times distance. His thinking went something like this. The farther something travels,the greater the action. The faster it goes,the greater the action. And if it's a particle,then the more massive it is, the greater the action. If there are multiplesegments to the journey, then the total action is just the sum of the mass times velocitytimes distance for each segment. To see the principle in action, here is a super simple examplewith no friction or losses. Imagine a 0.5 kilogram ballis rolled over the ground for 6 meters at 3 meters per second. Then that would be 9 units of action. If the ball then bounces and travels another 6 metersat 3 meters per second, then the action for the whole trip is 9 plus 9, or 18 units of action. Now, what Maupertuis claimed is that out of all possible trajectories where the ball bounces off the wall, the path it will follow is the one that minimizes the action. In 1744, he wrote, \"This action is thetrue expense of Nature, which she manages to makeas small as possible.\" So what was the response toMaupertuis' revolutionary idea? He was attacked and ridiculed. One of his longtime friends, a fellow physicist named Samuel Konig, wrote that \"not only isyour principal wrong, you also stole it from Leibniz.\" Voltaire, who used to be aclose friend of Maupertuis, accused him of plagiarism,bad physics, being stupid, and just about anythingelse he could think of. In fact, he wrote a 32-page pamphlet just to mock Maupertuis. Of course, this may havebeen partly due to rumors Voltaire's lover had anaffair with Maupertuis. But not everyone attacked him. Some just ignored him. Maupertuis, I've takena lot of math and physics in my life. I think you're the first personI ever heard pronounce it. He doesn't get much mention. All of this was terriblystressful for Maupertuis who was nearing the end of his life, and more than anything, he thought the principle of least action would be what he was remembered for. That would be his legacy. But now he was attacked,mocked, ridiculed, and ignored. Unfortunately, this treatment was at least somewhat justified because Maupertuis cameup with this principle by kind of just pickingit out of thin air. There was no obvious reasonwhy nature should care about mass times velocity times distance, or even less, why thatquantity should be minimized. And mathematically, theprinciple of least action wasn't rigorous either. But there was one man whovehemently defended it, and that man was Leonhard Euler. The first thing Euler did was he replaced the sum with an integral so you could calculate the action while speed or directionchanged continuously. And he used this to findthe path of a particle around a central mass, like the orbit of a planet around a star. Solving this meant thatout of every possible path between two points, he would have to find the one for which the action was the smallest. This is similar to theproblem Fermat tried to solve, only now, instead ofchanging one variable, he would have to vary everypossible point along the path, which is infinitely many. Needless to say, this was an arduous task. Math had not yet developed the tools required to handle such problems. Fortunately, Euler himselfinvented a new method. It was clunky and timeconsuming, but it worked. Through this process, he realized that theprinciple of least action only works if the totalenergy is conserved, and it is the same forall paths considered. These were two conditions that Maupertuis hadn'trealized were necessary. So Euler improved the mathematicalrigor of the principle. He found two extra conditions and he provided a specificexample of it working. Euler is an astonishingly powerful and not just great mathematician, but appears to be a good guy. As far as we could tell,he was very generous. You can still read Eulerand really understand it. He helps you, he's empathetic. You know, he was like you are, man. He's trying to explain stuff. But Euler was stillfar from a general proof. That would have to wait foranother legendary mathematician, Joseph-Louis Lagrange. Joseph-Louis Lagrangewas a shy 19-year-old, mostly self-taught. But despite his age, he was already working atthe forefront of mathematics, including with Euler's new method. In 1754, he shared his results with Euler, who replied that Lagrangehad \"extolled the theory to the highest summit of perfection,\" which caused him \"the greatest joy.\" But besides being worldclass mathematicians, the two had another thing in common. They were both huge proponents of the principle of least action. And around five years later, just a year after Maupertuis' death, Lagrange succeeded inproviding a general proof. Is there any intuitiveway to think about action? I feel like there's an intuitiveway to think about force and there's kind of an intuitiveway to think about energy, but is there an intuitiveway to think about action? I don't know. I wanna watch your show to learn. I hope you'll come up with it because I don't have agood feeling about action. [Derek] Now I wannaexplain Lagrange's proof, but I don't want to do it the way he did. So instead, we'll go through three steps. First we'll explain the general approach Euler and Lagrange came up with. Then we'll rewrite theprinciple into its modern form. And finally we'll apply thismath to a simple example to show you why it works. So first, the general approach. If there are infinite possible paths, how do you find the onewith the least action? Well, Euler and Lagrangerealized you can do it in a similar way to how youfind the minimum of a function. There you take the derivativeand set it equal to 0. And where the slope is horizontal,that must be the minimum. So if you took a tiny stepto the left or the right, the value of the functionbasically doesn't change. And similarly, if you havethe path of least action, then if you were to change it a little bit by, say, adding a tiny bumphere or flattening it out there, imagine we're just addinga tiny function, eta, to our path of least action, well, then the actionbasically shouldn't change because we're at thisreally special point, the path of least action. You add a little bit to the minimal path but the action is still the same. If that is the optimal paththat has the least action, then any other path must have more action. So the counter there is like all of this is the first order. So if you're looking at linear terms that are proportionalto eta, the deviation, then the first order, the difference in action will be 0. And the way you could imagine this is like let's say you're at the bottom of a bowl and you're at the minimum and you make some tiny stepaway and we call that step eta. If that change wouldbe proportional to eta, you would maybe increase on this side but decrease on this side and then this would nolonger be a minimum. So sort of the coefficientof eta has to be 0. But since you're at a minimum, it kind of goes like a parabola, so it can be proportional to eta squared or potentially some higher order term. So there is a tinydeviation in the action, but it's not proportional to eta. So the first order, the change in actionbetween the optimal path and some trial path is 0. So what you can write is that the action of this trial path minus the action of the true path is equal to 0 to first order. This is a compact way of writing the principle of least action, and it's the general approach you use to solve all these problems. So with that in hand, let's rewrite the principleinto its modern form, starting with Maupertuis' action, which is the sum of masstimes velocity times distance. But Euler changed this into an integral, so it's the integralof mass times velocity integrated over distance. Now the velocity is equal to ds over dt, which we can rearrangeto get ds equals vdt. And plugging this in, we have an integral ofmv squared over time. But wait, that's justtwice the kinetic energy. And as Euler pointed out, the total energy must be conserved. Total energy is justkinetic plus potential. So we can rewrite thisas T equals E minus V. And filling this in forthe second T gives us that the variation of T plusE minus V integrated over time is equal to 0. Now we can split this integral into two, and since the energy is constant, we can integrate this termover time to get this. And we can simplify this even further. Just like with a normal derivative, we can write the variation of E times t as E times the variation of t plus t times the variation of E. But remember, as Euler found, the energy of differentpaths has to be the same, so the variation between them is 0 and this term drops out. If we rearrange this like so, then we find that thevariation of this integral is equal to minus the energytimes the variation of time. This looks a lot like someother minimization principle, if only this was equal to 0. Well, we can make this 0 by only considering paths thathave the same travel time. If you do that, then there'sno longer any variation in time and this term drops out. And what we find is thatMaupertuis' principle has changed into another form where now the variation of kinetic energy minus potential energy integrated over time is equal to 0. T minus V, kinetic energyminus potential energy, and then you integrate that along a path that you're traveling from A to B, and then integrate itwith respect to time. It's all very strange and yet that turns out to bethe correct thing to integrate. [Derek] Now this is a little weird. We started with mass times velocity integrated over distance, and now we have the kinetic energy minus the potential energy integrated over time. And somehow both are ways to write the principle of least action. But that also meansthat this integral here, T minus V integrated over time, is another way to write the action. The first person to write the principleof least action like this was William Rowan Hamilton in 1834, and by doing so, he got theprinciple named after him. So the principle of least action that we write as integral of Ldt, L being being the Lagrangian, the T minus V, the kineticminus potential energy, they don't call it Lagrange's Principle, they call it Hamilton's Principle. So I guess Hamilton is buildingon Lagrange in that way. Hamilton's Principle is the modern way of writing the principle of least action and the way you'd find it inalmost every physics book. In part that's becauseHamilton's Principle tells you how objects move from one place to another rather than just givingyou the shape of the path. Two other important differencesbetween both principles are that the action isnow an integral over time instead of space. And a consequence is thatwith Hamilton's Principle, you now need a start and end point, and also a start and end time. The third is that withMaupertuis' principle, you need to keep the energyof different paths the same, but the time can vary. While with Hamilton's Principle, the energies can differ but the time has to bethe same between paths. So now we have our general approach and the modern way ofwriting the principle, so let's apply it to a simpleexample to see why it works. Let's say I throw this ballstraight up in the air, so it goes from some start point to say a different end pointin a certain amount of time. Now if we call the heightof the ball y of t, then we can plot these two points like so, and then we can imagine infinitely many possible trajectories that could connect these two points. Some go a little higher, some lower, some have wiggles, others don't. The only condition is that all paths must havethe same start and end point and the same amount oftime elapsed between them. Now to find the real trajectory, we proceed as before. We imagine that this isthe true path, y of t, the one with the least action. And then we imagine makingsmall variations to it by pushing it up a little here, down a little there, and so on, making tiny changes at every time step, which we'll call eta of t. So when you add y and eta together, you get this new trial path, let's call it q of t. And since the variations are small, the difference in actionbetween these two paths is 0. Our next task is to solve this equation. So we compute the action for each path. For this, we need the kineticand potential energy for each, and we write them as afunction of y and eta. Plugging that in, you get the difference inactions is equal to this. But wait, this first integral is just the action of the true path, so these integrals cancel, and what you're left with is just that. m times dy over dt times d eta over dt minus eta times thederivative of the potential integrated over time is equal to 0. We can rewrite this furtherby using integration by parts. That allows us to replacethis term with this one. And if we plug that in, we now have some function that when multiplied by etaand integrated over time has to be equal to 0. But since eta can be just about anything, this can only be true if this part is 0. So what we found is that theaction is minimal for the path that satisfies this curiousdifferential equation. Now it might lookcomplicated, but it's not. Minus the derivative of thepotential is just the force. And the second derivative of height? Well, that's just acceleration. So if we rearrange this, we find that the path that satisfies the principle of least action is the one that obeys F equals ma. In other words, the principleof least action is equivalent to Newton's Second Law, but it covers more than just mechanics. Fermat's principle of least time turned out to be nothingmore than a special case of the principle of least action. So with this single principle, you could suddenly describe everything, from light reflecting and refracting, to the swinging of a pendulum clock, to planets orbiting the sun and stars orbiting the core of the galaxy. What used to be viewed as entirely separate fields of physics were now all unified undera single simple rule. The variation of the action is 0. After Euler found outabout Lagrange's proof, he wrote to him, \"How satisfied wouldnot Mr. Maupertuis be, were he still alive, if he could see hisprinciple of least action applied to the highest degree of dignity to which it is susceptible.\" With Lagrange's proof, we now have two ways tosolve any mechanics problem. You can either use forces and vectors or you can use energies and scalars. It seems like theprinciple of police action is just way too complicated. It is so unnecessary. Who would ever use this, you know, when you could just useNewton's Second Law? Like that's a piece of cake. Your options are either use all of this or just start with F equals ma, and they give you the same answer. Why ever use theprinciple of least action? Well, that's because Euler andLagrange came up with a way to make all of this likesuper, super simple. [Derek] If this is the action, then T minus V is called the Lagrangian. Now let's replace everything we did before with the Lagrangian. Then you see that theprinciple of least action works whenever this differentialequation is satisfied. So all you have to do now if you wanna solve any mechanics problem is you just write down thekinetic and potential energy and you plug it into thisequation and you're done. And that becomes extremely powerful. I remember thinking, \"Man, force is like hardto get the right answer.\" You can do it if you're good, and people who are goodat mechanics can do it. But with the Lagrangian approach, you have this machine crank out the principleof least action on it and you get the right equation to motion and you don't have to be a good physicist. That was what I took from it, that as a math guy I can do physics thanks to Lagrange and Euler. And it doesn't justwork in one dimension. If you have more dimensions, then you just solve theEuler-Lagrange equation for each coordinate. Another thing that's great is you could use weird coordinate systems that might be bettersuited to the problem. Like if you were doing aproblem with something rotating, you might want to use polar coordinates instead of Cartesian coordinates. And this will give you thecorrect equations of motion in polar coordinates, which again might be kind oftricky to do with vectors. [Derek] Like with the double pendulum. Trying to solve this usingforces is extremely hard. Because as one pendulum is swinging, it provides the attachment point for the pendulum hanging below it, and so that pendulum is inthis moving reference frame as it's swinging. It's a very nasty job to writedown the correct F equals ma for a double pendulum. But if you write it down withkinetic and potential energy, it's pretty easy. This is actually howwe made this simulation. Now, there is one little side note we should give about theprinciple of least action, because the name is a little misleading. Although we often refer to the principle as the principle of least action, it's probably good toadd a little caveat here, that sometimes it's notnecessarily the minimum. Just as when you find in calculus when you set a derivative to 0, that doesn't guaranteeyou're getting the minimum of a function. The principle of leastaction more properly stated should be the principleof stationary action. That the laws of motion come from demanding a stationary point, which is tantamount to this condition of setting a certain derivative to 0 and then getting theEuler-Lagrange equation from that. So very often it is a trueminimum, but not always. But action is much more fundamental than just classical mechanics. Around the turn of the 20th century, action popped up as thekey part of a solution to one of the biggestproblems in atomic physics at the time. The UV catastrophe. It's kind of spookythat this breakthrough that starts the ball rollingtoward quantum theory brings action in. Not energy and not force, action. It gives you a hint, yeah.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: science and history of escalators"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "thousands of football fans were making their way to the game in Rome. Excitement for the game was high, and the fans began to chant and sing. At 7:03 pm, around 50 people were riding the long escalator down to the platform, but within 30 seconds, the crowd had swelled to nearly double that. Everything seemed fine, but inside the escalator was a problem. The weight of the passengers was bearing down on the steps, and the load on the main motor was increasing. To try to slow the descent, the motor applied a counter torque. But as the force continued to increase, the stairs began to move faster. By 7:04 pm, the crowd had tripled. The motor finally reached its limit, and under the massive strain, the drum began to slip. With the motor losing control, the escalator triggered its second line of defense. A safety relay tripped, immediately cutting power to the motor. The main brake clamped down on the metal drum to stop the descent of the stairs, but, it failed. The friction on the main drum wasn't enough to stop the motor from spinning, and the stairs continued to accelerate. Sensing the motor had lost control of the steps, the escalator engaged the last line of defense. In the event of an emergency, an auxiliary break is designed to bypass the motor entirely and directly lock the drive shaft. Under normal circumstances, the chance that all three safety measures fail at the same time is vanishingly small. But these weren't normal circumstances. At 7:05 pm, the third and final safety system failed, and the stairs began to plummet. Fans were flung forward and started streaming down the escalator. Some lept over the central barrier in desperation, while others were swept into a crushing pileup. At the bottom, the landing became a dangerous choke point. Under the pressure, the steps twisted and buckled into jagged metal, leaving 24 people injured. Something like this shouldn't have been possible, and experts at the time knew that something had gone wrong, and they started to suspect foul play. In the aftermath, Rome's Transit Agency sealed off the accident site and closed the Republica station for several months. The authorities ordered both a technical and a criminal investigation, and the mayor even publicly vowed to discover the cause of the accident. So investigators began dismantling the wreck, tearing it down piece by piece to reconstruct what had happened. The ride people experienced on that escalator was one of the most terrifying rides of their lives. But maybe it's more similar to the origin of escalators than you might think. Like what was the first escalator even used for? Do you wanna have a guess? It was an attraction in a theme park all the way back in 1896. It had no steps, a 25 degree incline, and it was essentially just a slow conveyor belt made of metal and wooden parts. It brought people up a full seven feet before they would have to walk downstairs on the other side, and it was a huge success. Over 75,000 people enjoyed the attraction during its two week stay at the Old Iron Pier on Coney Island. The ride was named the Continuous Elevator and its inventor, Jesse Reno, had created it not just as an attraction, but as a proof of concept, because he saw it as the future of transportation. But as Reno watched people ride his invention, he began to notice a pattern. Nobody walked. Instead, they stood still, feet planted firmly sideways with people gripping the handrail tightly. Two years later, the department store Harrods in England installed a similar device, but the ride was so unsettling that Harrods had to put staff at the top to offer brandy to men and smelling salts to women just to calm their nerves. You see, for both devices, the 25 degree conveyor belt was precarious to walk on and unnerving to stand on. At around 12 degrees, walking on an incline becomes difficult, and 25 degrees is roughly the limit that our ankles can flex. If only there was a way to replace the conveyor belt with a moving set of stairs. Well, then the riders would always have a flat surface to stand on and a staircase they could climb if they wanted to. One attempt at a solution had already been around for four decades, and it was called the revolving stairs. It consisted of a chain that went around a loop, then fixed stair shaped blocks were attached to it, creating a flat surface to stand on during the main incline. But as soon as you'd reached the top, the steps tilted forward, making it treacherous to get off, and a similar problem plagued you at the bottom. Now, you might think if the top and bottom are causing problems, just extend each landing, but that also doesn't work. You just end up with a jagged mess for longer. So how do modern escalators solve this problem? I mean, have you ever stopped to think what happens to the stairs at the top of the escalator when they disappear? Clearly, we have steps going around in some sort of loop, but how do they actually behave on the return journey? What if I give you two options? Do they stay right side up like the cabins in a Ferris wheel, or do they flip upside down and then flip back again at the other side? - I'm gonna go this one all day. - Ferris wheel. - This one makes more sense. - Ferris Wheel. - Yeah, this one. - I think they turn upside down. - And they're actually right side up. - I think I'm gonna go with this. - Wow. You're both - They just keep- - Yeah. - The solution to this problem came from another inventor named George Wheeler. His idea forms the basis of every escalator in use today. A modern version of it works something like this. A typical subway escalator has an electric motor at the top with a power output of around 50 kilowatts. Smaller than most electric cars. This motor spins extremely fast at over a 1,000 RPM, but it's pretty weak. So to drive the steps, the escalator needs to convert this into a slower output with more force. To do this, it uses a reduction gearbox in a gear system, lowering the output to just a few RPM and increasing the torque by a factor of around 100. The motor is connected with a large sprocket to a reinforced steel chain, which pulls the stairs around a loop. The so-called step chain is fitted with wheels to allow it to roll smoothly around curves. But unlike the design for the revolving stairs, Wheeler proposed attaching each step to this chain through a single axle, giving it the freedom to rotate. Next, he added a second set of wheels to each step that followed a different track, allowing him to control the angle of each step at any point. On the incline, the two tracks overlap just like the revolving staircase, but then at the top, the two tracks separate, and this is what allows us to keep the steps level throughout the entire ride. The tracks then remain separated and curve around. The steps flip upside down, tuck into the loop, and start their return journey. At the start of the incline, the tracks rejoin and the whole process repeats. - So the answer is, you are both wrong. - Oh my God. - I don't want to be interviewed anymore. - Yeah. - Wow. I never really thought about that. - Yeah, like, I would say, it's like a upside down elevator, bro. - Guess what? You're right. - Yeah? - Yeah. - But despite all modern escalators adopting Wheeler's design, at the time, it caught so little attention that he was forced to shelve the idea. It wasn't until eight years later that another inventor, Charles Seeberger, bought his patent and capitalized on the invention. Seeberger partnered with the Otis Elevator Company, and together they built a prototype. A year later, in 1900, they showcased it at the Paris Exposition Universelle. In total, 51 million people flocked to the exposition to see the marvels of modern technology. But one of the most popular exhibitions was the world's first true commercial escalator. The machine drew huge crowds. French historian Philippe Jullian described it as the jolliest attraction at the exhibition and wrote, \"The escalator caused many an incident worthy \"of the vaudeville, separating families, \"sending old men sprawling, delighting the children, \"and reducing their nannies to despair.\" The escalator was even awarded one of the grand prizes of the fair. Shortly after, escalators started being installed in different places across the world. But these escalators weren't perfect. They had smooth flat stairs, and when they reached the top, these stairs would disappear under a wooden board, leaving a dangerous gap between them. Shoe laces, coats, and especially the long skirts in fashion at the time easily got caught in the machinery. One incident even saw a three year girl getting her foot pinched in the gap. And while the girl luckily escaped with injured toes and a missing shoe, something in the design had to change. To solve this, Seeberger and Otis installed a triangular shunt at the end of the escalator, forcing rider to go off to the left before they reached the dangerous gap. This system worked, but it was awkward because it meant people had to put one foot onto solid ground while the other was still moving, which became especially tricky when some people stood still and others walked. So to reduce the risk of people getting in each other's way, operators asked people to stand on the right and keep the left lane clear for faster walkers. It's a convention we still often follow to this day, but as it turns out, there's a much better solution than the shunt. Modern escalator steps aren't smooth, they're grooved. These grooves then interlock perfectly with a comb plate at the top of the escalator. So now, if a small item approaches the end, the comb plate lifts it up and out of harm's way. This makes it much harder for things to get stuck, and perhaps more importantly, it allows people to safely step off forwards. But the comb plate doesn't entirely solve the problem. We still have these gaps on the side of the escalator that can pinch and trap objects as the steps move. So to address this, a new safety feature called the skirt brush was added to the escalator in 1982. Escalators are full of subtle safety features like this, some old and some new, but almost all of them are designed around people. All the way back in 1896, Jesse Reno predicted that riders on his attraction would need something to hold onto, so he introduced a moving handrail. In a modern escalator, the motor has a separate connection to turn a friction wheel that drives the handrail. The only problem is that friction wears things down. So over time, the wheel gets smaller, and as its circumference decreases, each rotation moves the rubber loop a slightly shorter distance, so the handrail begins to move more slowly. The effect is small, but it builds up over time. So to compensate for this, a new handrail is calibrated to move around 2% faster than the steps. You can actually try this yourself. Next time you're standing on an escalator, just place your hand next to you as you stand still, and you will watch as your hand slowly drifts forward. This speed difference stops the handrail from lagging too far behind the steps over time. - Because I have definitely noticed that, that sometimes I'm on an escalator and then it's going faster than me. My hand is going faster than my body, but that means it's a new escalator. - Well, it's a new frictional wheel. That wheel that drives the hand, we don't replace, we don't replace the entire escalator. - Oh, wow, so that's like a party trick I can use to entertain my friends. I mean, I don't know when I'd have a party on an escalator, but whatever, if I'm on an escalator with my friends and I can see it moving, I'd be like, \"Hey, that's 'cause there's a new frictional wheel.\" I can tell them that and impress them. - But it's not just the handrail. The speed of the steps themselves is also something that needs to be carefully controlled. And modern escalators use AC induction motors, which are extremely good at regulating their rotational speed. And this has an unexpected benefit on downward escalators. With enough people riding, their weight is enough that the motor no longer has to power the ride. Instead, the weight of the passengers themselves drives the chain and causes the motor to spin. As more people board, the force on the motor increases, and it's pushed to turn faster. But modern AC induction motors work by creating a rotating magnetic field. When the motor tries to spin faster than the field, electric currents are induced inside it, which then create their own magnetic field. This new field pushes back in the opposite direction to the spin, creating a braking force, which resists the increase in speed. But something interesting happens when the motor resists like this, rather than consuming energy, the physics of the motor flips and it uses the excess mechanical energy to produce an electric current. This is called regenerative braking, and it's the same trick that electric vehicles use to recharge their batteries. In effect, the motor turns into a generator. The result is that on a busy day, many modern downward escalators aren't just moving people, they're actually generating electricity. Often this is channeled back to the building's internal grid and used to power other devices, including the upward escalators. - So even the escalator that was invented by George Wheeler and was installed in 1920, the Paris Exhibition, et cetera, I mean, all these escalators were regenerators. - What? - Yeah, when there were people standing on the escalator in down direction, these escalators were feeding energy back into the grid. - No, it's like the down escalator's a generator? - This regenerative braking makes escalators extremely power efficient, but more importantly, it makes them inherently safe. But there is a point where if you keep adding weight, then eventually the force becomes so strong that the motor can no longer resist it. And if left unchecked, it would start accelerating uncontrollably. The stairs would go plummeting down, which is exactly what happened in Rome. After a nearly two year long investigation, the investigators published this 86 page report. Inside it lists the exact sequence of events that led to the disaster. As fans crowded onto the escalator, their combined weight increased the load on the main motor. The motor tried to resist this change, but as more and more people funneled on, the force got too high, and eventually it hit a tipping point and the motor started accelerating uncontrollably. Safety sensors in the machine noticed this sudden change and triggered two things in short succession. At first, the power to the motor was cut, and immediately after that, the main brake engaged. Two massive arms clamped down on the drum to lock it in place and avert a runaway. This break should have had enough stopping power to bring the fully loaded escalator to a halt, even under the massive strain, but it didn't. Tests after the incident showed that its braking force was far too low, around 37% of the manufacturer's specification. The weakened brake struggled to slow the spinning motor and the escalators downhill acceleration continued. This is when the last line of defense kicked in. When the escalator speed rose by more than 20%, the auxiliary brake triggered driving steel wedges into a disc on the drive shaft. But when investigators opened up this brake, they were shocked. The final mechanical backstop had been partially disabled. Someone had physically tied plastic straps around one of the two brake wedges and rendered it useless. (dramatic music) With half the system unable to engage, its stopping power was cut by 50%, just enough for the weight of all those passengers to overpower the brake and render the last line of defense useless. Investigators knew that these failures should have been automatically recorded in the error logs, but when they went to check, they found nothing. The error codes had been turned off. Meaning critical malfunctions could occur without leaving a trace. The only way this could happen was if they had been disabled on purpose, meaning someone must have reprogrammed the system to stop recording fault codes. Next investigators turn to the maintenance records, but they found these similarly incomplete and evidence of major work on the escalator was nowhere to be found at all. With all the main safety systems compromised and critical alerts turned off, the escalator had been a ticking time bomb. All findings from the technical investigation pointed not to a manufacturing defect, but to a pattern of neglect and falsification by those in charge of keeping the machine safe. This left the prosecution with one clear question, who was responsible? The trail of evidence led back to June, 2017 when maintenance responsibilities for Rome's escalators shifted to a new contractor, Metro Roma. The Transit Authority ATAC severed its contract with Metro Roma in an attempt to wash its hands of the situation. But as the criminal inquest continued, it became clear that the problem went far deeper. The investigators discovered that Metro Roma had been working hand in hand with the Transit Authority ATAC, and together they presided over negligent maintenance and falsified records all across the network. By September 2019, 11 suspects were named and the courts had suspended three ATAC managers along with the chief of Metro Roma. The prosecution's findings were grave. In many cases, safety devices had been deliberately sabotaged to avoid escalator shutdowns, and those in charge had covered their tracks through a pattern of fraud and obstruction. In the midst of the public outrage, prosecutors recorded a chilling wiretap of ATAC Manager Renato Domico. The translation, \"If you run the numbers, \"out of 700 escalators, there'd be like three \"or four more dropping. Come on.\" The prosecutors note in their report that Domico appeared uninterested in the possibility there might have been people on those three or four escalators. It was simply a matter of numbers and percentages to him. It was a callous remark and it painted a clear picture of the incident. This wasn't an engineering failure, it was a human one. But that brings us to a more fundamental question. I mean, how safe are escalators really? The truth is when they're properly maintained, the safety margins on escalators are enormous. Each system is engineered to handle forces far beyond what they'll ever see in service. - So the breaking load of our step is like greater 15 kilonewtons to 1.5 tons. So you can put an elephant on the step and it won't break. Well, I've never seen a step break in my work career. Never seen a step chain break either. I mean, it's does not happen. I mean, I'm not here to say that there are no accidents on an escalator, but the accidents I know, I mean, it's critical like that you, that you ensure the right maintenance. That's the most important thing, because in the end, it's all about maintenance. - When this is done right, the chances of a catastrophic failure are vanishingly small and with around 1.5 million escalators worldwide, that really is how it should be. In the US and Canada alone, over a hundred billion escalator trips are happening every year, making the escalator one of the most widely used forms of transport on the planet. On a scale that large, it's sometimes easy to point the finger at our technology when things go wrong. But the truth is, no matter how well designed our systems are, they all rely on people to maintain them. And perhaps that's the lesson here. As humans, we have a duty of care, not just to ourselves, but to everyone around us. And sometimes that means taking responsibility for keeping each other safe. (gentle music) In a way, that's how the escalators story began with one person deciding to take responsibility for a problem that everyone else ignored. Back when Jesse Reno was at university, every day, he had to climb more than 300 steps to get to his frat house. But while everyone else complained about this, Reno did something about it. He had the math, the science, and most importantly, the problem solving skills to create the world's very first escalator, which he took to Coney Island.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: how jet engines work and why they don't melt"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is one of the most powerful jet engines in the world. And it actually runs at temperatures 250\u00b0 C hotter than the melting point of the materials that make it up. That's 12,200\u00b0. So the question is, why doesn't a jet engine just melt into a puddle? We are right at the boundaries of the laws of physics. That is wild. It's at the same temperature now as it would be inside the jet engine. But here, they're liquid. Every time I get on a plane, I'm thinking, \"This is never going to work.\" And yet, it does work. Right now, there are over 10,000 planes in the sky powered by engines just like these. Maybe you are on one right now. So, how do they work? This is a jet engine, specifically a turboan engine. At the front is this giant fan. During takeoff, these rotating blades push 1.3 tons of air backwards every second, and around 10% of that air gets compressed. The compressors force the air into increasingly narrow chambers. They compress the air to about 50 times atmospheric pressure. And just by doing that, the air heats up to around 600\u00b0 C. This compressed air is then forced into the combustion chamber where fuel is sprayed in through a ring of nozzles and ignited. That chemical reaction gives off a lot of heat. So the temperature jumps to around 1,500\u00b0 C. So now you've got this high pressure gas from the combuster that just wants to expand. And now it's got an incredible amount of thermal energy. But between the combustion chamber and the outside air is this rows of turbine blades. So in order for the gas to expand and get out, it needs to push these turbine blades out of the way. And in pushing the blades, that is how it transfers its energy to the engine. This is where all the power really comes from. In modern jets, on takeoff, each high-pressure turbine blade is generating as much power as a Formula 1 car. And there are 68 of them. As the gas rushes through the turbine and nozzle, its pressure drops from around 50 atmospheres down to one, and it expands by almost 20 times. And that spins these turbine blades up to 12,500 revolutions per minute. The fan that is pushing all that air backward and all those compressors that squeeze the air down, all of that is powered by the turbines back here. It's a kind of funny, really counterintuitive way to think about an engine. It's what's happening in the back that's actually driving everything up front. As the hot exhaust gas is shot out the back of the engine, it pushes the engine forward. That generates thrust. But did you know that in a modern passenger jet, this accounts for less than 20% the thrust of the engine? The vast majority of the thrust, over 80% of it, just comes from that big fan at the front of the jet. Remember how only 10% of the incoming air gets compressed? The other 90% bypasses all that. It's simply propelled backwards by the fan. and it goes right around the guts of the engine and comes straight out the back. The fan pushes that air backwards. So, the air pushes the fan forwards. That's how you get 80% of the thrust. It's basically a huge ducted propeller. So, why do it this No text way? I mean, why not compress all the incoming air and put it all through the combustion chamber and turbines? Well, some fighter jets do exactly this, and it makes for very powerful engines, but they're also horribly inefficient. To see why, remember that the impulse pushing the plane forward is equal to the change in the momentum of the air backwards. So, you've got options. For example, you could push twice as much air back half as fast, or you could push half as much air back twice as fast. Both will generate the exact same impulse, but the kinetic energy of the air is proportional to V squared. So it takes four times as much energy to speed up the air in the second case. And a lot of that energy is just wasted in the exhaust. So ideally, you want to push as much air backwards as possible with only a small change in velocity. That's why jets have gotten bigger and bigger over the years. and the increasing fraction of bypass air has the added benefit that it surrounds the hot exhaust gases and that reduces noise coming away from the jet. But there is another major factor when it comes to engine efficiency and that is temperature. At cruising altitudes around 35,000 ft the outside air is around55\u00b0 C while inside the engine it's over 1,500\u00b0. The hot high-pressure gas inside the engine wants to expand into the much colder, lower pressure air outside. It's that difference that lets the engine turn heat into useful work. But there's a fundamental limit to how much work any heat engine can get from that. It's called the carno efficiency. It's equal to 1 minus the temperature of the cold outside air divided by the temperature of the hot gas inside the combustion chamber. So looking at this, you can improve the efficiency of the engine in two ways. Either fly where the air is colder or raise the temperature in the combustion chamber. One problem with that though is that it turned the inside of a jet engine into one of the harshest No text environments we have ever built in which machinery has to survive. To keep a turbine blade whole and unaffected within an engine is like putting an ice cube inside your oven, turning up to max, leaving for work, coming back after an eight hour shift, and finding it still completely frozen in the oven. That's what we've got to try and do within that engine. It sounds absurd. Not only do the turbine blades sit in a stream of gas that's over,500\u00b0 C, they're also spinning at 12,500 RPM with the tip of each blade slicing through the air at nearly 1,900 kmh. Now, every blade wants to fly straight, but it's forced to spin in a circle, which means something has to be constantly pulling it inwards. That's the centrial force. If you take a representative 300 g high-pressure turbine blade and run it at that speed and radius, it has to be pulled inwards with a force equal to the weight of 20 metric tons. That's roughly the weight of two London double-decker buses tugging on each blade as it spins, all while they're glowing hot. To make matters worse, at these temperatures, oxygen wants to react with the metal of the blades itself. And on top of all that, the air rushing through the engine often carries dust, sand, and pollutants that can damage and erode the surfaces inside. And somehow these blades have to survive this punishment for tens of thousands of flight hours without deforming, cracking, or failing. They really determine how efficient you can make the engine because you can't make the engine so hot that the blades can't withstand that temperature. So they determine the maximum temperature of the combustion chamber and therefore the maximum efficiency you can realize with a jet engine. So what kind of metal could possibly survive these conditions? Well, we sent Veritassium producer Amelia to the department of material science and metal energy at Cambridge University to put some different metals to the test. So this is the steel. This is the steel sample. Yes. Okay. So, we got about 200 megapascals to start with, which is sort of comparable to some of the stress that's seen by these components in real applications. And we're going to put that stress on and then slowly increase the temperature. This is a mild steel. It's relatively strong and easy to form into complex shapes. It seems like a pretty good bet for a turbine blade. And at first, under this load and at these low temperatures, it holds up pretty well. We're essentially tugging on all the atoms within the metal. We're not breaking or forming any bonds. We're just making them flex a little and that slightly changes the spacing between the atoms. And as a result, the metal gets slightly longer. This resulting change in size, specifically the per unit change in length, is what we call strain. Critically, at this stage, the material is behaving elastically. If we remove the load right now, the material just snaps back to its original size. In an engine, some elastic deformation like this will occur. It can't be too big or it'll cause problems. But what we really don't want is plastic deformation if the shape changes permanently. And that's exactly what starts to happen as we keep increasing the temperature. It's getting hot now. That's a little bit of oxide. There you go. See this starting to deform. Now bonds are breaking and reforming as the metal atus deforms permanently. But this doesn't happen all at once. So I got the mechanical engineer on our team, Henry, to build this demo. No text Okay, so you can see we're getting a bunch of tiny little bubbles. And just naturally, they're packing into this hexagonal arrangement. And there actually a lot of materials that have atomic structures just like this. But you can see it's not perfect. Like right here, you can see there's an extra half plane of atoms. Well, in this case, bubbles. This is called an edge dislocation. [Music] And it becomes really interesting when I try to pull this raft apart. You can see these little dark lines that zip back and forth. Those are dislocations and they move through the lattice. As the dislocation moves, it'll cause one plane of bubbles to shear past the other one, which shifts the structure by exactly one spacing. But there isn't just one dislocation. There are plenty of them. And altogether their movement produces dramatic changes in the overall shape. That's exactly what's happening here. Everywhere that stress is high enough, billions of dislocations are moving and interacting. The steel starts to deform continuously under this constant load in a process called creep. It takes energy to break the atomic bonds as a dislocation travels through the lattice. So as we ramp up the temperature and all the atoms get more thermal energy, it no longer requires as much stress to break these bonds. becomes much easier for the dislocations to move. The metal effectively gets softer. Now the steel's strength drops so much that the slow time dependent creep gives way to rapid deformation. As it stretches, it rapidly decreases in cross-section and eventually the remaining metal can no longer bear the load. Now you could try doing similar tests for other metals like this titanium alloy. Titanium is about half as dense as steel. Should feel that's quite a bit lighter. Yeah, it's like loads lighter. So, if we were to make turbine blades out of titanium, each blade would be much lighter and that would reduce the enormous centrial forces it would experience. So, it seems like a great choice. And at first, it performs really well. That's 100\u00b0. It's hanging in there. But as we push the temperature higher, oh, I can see some glowing. Oh, look at it. Oh, it's gone already. Just like the steel, its strength drops rapidly as temperature increases. And that's true for most metals. No text Yet, the first jet engine dating back all the way to 1941 actually did use steel turbine blades. It was designed by British pilot and engineer Frank Whittle. His engine powered the first flight of a British jet aircraft, the Gloucester E2839 prototype. When a colleague excitedly told Whittle, \"Frank, it flies.\" He dryly quipped. That was bloody well what it was designed to do, wasn't it? But Whittle's prototype had two major flaws. The first was that the gas inside the engine only reached temperatures of around 780\u00b0 C, which was one of the reasons it was inefficient. And the second was that it was only allowed to fly for up to 10 hours. Any longer and it was too likely parts inside the engine would fail. And both of these drawbacks were largely due to the steel turbine blades. Something that occurred to me is why aren't they made out of tungsten? I mean, because tungsten doesn't melt until 3,400\u00b0 C, which is more than twice the temperature inside a modern jet engine. But tungsten is also incredibly dense. It's about 2 and 1/2 times denser than steel. And it's also brittle, which makes it hard to manufacture. And using a material that heavy wouldn't just make the blade a problem. The components that hold the blade in the engine would also have to carry much higher loads well beyond what current materials can handle. So you can optimize for one thing like the melting point or a different thing like strength or weight, but the turbine pushes every variable to its limit. So what are these blades actually made of? Well, to find out, we went to Rolls-Royce's precision casting facility in Derby. And it turns out the world's No text most advanced metal parts begin life as well something surprising. What is with the like the pink and the green there? Well, I'll come and show you. I'll come and show you. I'm just seeing so many cool things around here. Like what is that? Why does it look like that? You just enter this room and I smell the wax. Smells like a candle factory in here. Absolutely. So investment casting is a really really ancient technology. So, our ancestors have been doing investment casting to make jewelry, to make weapons for millennia. We've just perfected it here to make turbine blades. It's so wacky. This is just not how I'd expect it to happen at all. Turbine blades strike me as one of the most high-tech things in the world. Yep. And yet, this facility is using wax as a starting point. What you will see through our tour today is that actually it's a really highly technological process. This is our wax pattern die. This is how a turbine blade starts its life. So this is what's going to go inside the wax pattern, a ceramic core. This is going to create the hollow inside the turbine blade. So what's happening now is we're injecting into the dye. So that's the the very start of the life of a turbine blade. That is really neat. What we'll actually see is that a lot of these features such as the aeraf foil and the amul surfaces are not touched further. So we will cast that and that will remain as cast as it goes into the engine. Every surface here has to be perfect because this wax is what will become the blade. So Kim is our wax pattern assembler. So she's responsible for taking the product straight from that dye. Making sure that things like die lines have been removed. So where the die blocks come together and leave a small amount of flash. The operative word in in all of wax assembly is smooth. Every tiny imperfection in the wax would become a flaw in the metal. So this takes an incredible amount of skill. Then it's a case of getting that wax pattern attached to the unit runner to create the assembly. I mean the thought that occurs to me, right? Shouldn't you be doing this with a robot? Can't you know? Yeah. Yeah. So, Rolls-Royce has facilities that do this by robot, but our facility in particular is very much focused on bringing in those new products, and it's far far easier for us to work with human beings to develop that method of manufacturer that's going to bring the next generation of product through. I'll bet I can see the skill here. Like, it's phenomenal. I'll just make a mess of it. Absolutely. So would I. Would you like to go? No. Once the wax assembly is perfect, it's ready for the next stage. Everything that is wax is going to become air. It's going to become negative space, right? It's going to become our cavity. And then we're going to fill that air with metal. So, we take that wax assembly and we've got to build a shell. Shell is made of many different layers. It's a zirkon based uh shell system. We're going to dip into a primary slurry. It's really quite thin, like a light syrup or a thin honey. Oh, yeah. And what that's designed to do is map all of those really complex geometric features. Beautiful. It's like making icing. So, that's actually the analogy we use. So, it's a bit like if you put icing on top of a bun or a cake, you need to sprinkle it with some sugar afterwards. Otherwise, it's all going to slop off the top. So, we've got the slurry on there. We're going to get a nice even coat, drain it, make sure that it's an even thin layer, and then we're going to sand. And that's then going to set that layer in place. So cool. Wow. We're then going to dry it. So, it's air dried for many, many hours. And then we can create our backup layers. So our backup layers, it's a much thicker slurry, more like a treele. And the sand is much coarser, more like a granulated sugar. And we're going to maybe put four, five, maybe even six layers to back up because what we need is we need a mold that can withstand the casting parameters that we're putting it under. You know, it's it's it's got a lot of work to do. The wax is then melted out and the mold is fired. Oh yeah, that is wild. cleaned and tested to make sure there aren't any cracks. When it's done, the shell is ready to hold molten metal. This is a billet of alloy that's going to fill the whole of that mold. So, just that amount of metal is going to fill that whole mold there. It doesn't look like enough. No text This is a nickel alloy. The first nickel alloys used in jet engines were developed in the 1940s. By adding chromium and cobalt, engineers created alloys that could handle 800 to 900\u00b0 C, around 100\u00b0 hotter than the steel used before. And these alloys could keep their strength for thousands of hours, a 10-fold improvement in life. But the real breakthrough came when they added a touch of aluminum. So, we wanted to see how it held up under the same lab conditions as the steel and titanium. What temperature are we at now? That's uh 700\u00b0. 700. And steel's long gone. Steel's long gone. That's 800\u00b0. 800? Yes. In fact, around this temperature, it's actually getting stronger. So, why would heating a metal make it stronger? Well, when these nickel alloys were first used in jet engines, no one actually knew. But about 10 years later, electron microscopes had improved enough for engineers to finally see what was happening inside. As we zoom in on the alloy, a pattern emerges. The micro structure isn't uniform. Instead, it kind of looks like a city grid made up of blocks with roads in between them. Only each block is so small over 300 would line up across the width of a human hair. Now, surprisingly, both the roads and the blocks are made up of the exact same atoms, mostly nickel with a little aluminum. They even have the same crystal structure, a grid of tiny cubes with atoms sitting at the corners and at the center of each face. The only difference is that the atoms are arranged slightly differently. In the road structure, the aluminum and nickel can take any spot. There is no repeating sequence from cube to cube. And this is known as the gamma phase. But in the blocks, aluminum always takes the corner spots and nickel the faces. And you get a perfect repeating pattern cube after cube. This is the gamma prime phase. And it's this difference that is crucial when a dislocation tries to glide through the lattice. In the roads, this motion is easy. Each layer of atoms can shear smoothly past the next, leaving the structure looking unchanged behind it. But if you try to do the same thing in the blocks, well, now you're actually changing the order of the atoms. Nickel and aluminum end up sitting in the wrong places. That takes energy, so the lattice resists it. So when a dislocation moving through the roads hits a block, it gets stuck. And that's what makes this alloy so strong. But if you keep pushing and the stress gets high enough, dislocation can finally force its way in. The catch is that this dislocation leaves the lattice in such a high energy mess that the only way that it can keep moving is if there's a second one right behind it that puts things back in order. So in the gamma prime phase, dislocations have to travel in pairs called super dislocations. I need that creation of those super dislocations and I need that very high stress to be able to shear. So that's why the strength is very high relative to other alloys. What happens is ultimately because you're shearing through that gamma prime with two dislocations. As the temperature continuously increases, you're adding more and more thermal energy in the material. What happens is the atoms are going to vibrate more and more and more. So there's a likelihood as I'm doing this and oscillating in three dimensions that the thermal energy is going to drive me to actually slip down rather than just slip in one plane. So now if one cross lips, they're no longer on the same plane. Think of it as if we're standing in in line and the only way that you can move is if I push you, right? And then I keep on pushing you and then suddenly you drop. So if I now try to push you, I I I cannot find you, right? You're not in front of me anymore. Your your your shoulders are now below me. Why are you touching? I should have used the other example, you pushing me, but anyway, but it's exactly that. It's the it's the exact same analogy. There's nothing to push me anymore. there's like I am not able to do it. So now you've got these two dislocations that are on different planes. So they can't travel together anymore and as a result they're both now locked into place. And you can see that effect on this graph. While steel and titanium strength drops off in the nickel super alloy you actually get a peak. That's because the extra thermal energy lets more dislocations cross slip and get separated. And it's that that shuts down the motion of dislocations. But if gamma prime is so strong, why don't we just make the entire turbine blade out of it? Well, that strength comes at a cost. Gamma prime stops the dislocation so effectively that it becomes brittle. All it takes is one crack or a sudden impact and it could lead to a sudden failure. So, the real trick is in striking the right balance between enough gamma prime to trap the dislocations and to prevent this creep, but also enough gamma to keep the alloy ductile so that it can bend without breaking. And in our test, you can see exactly how that plays out. 1,000\u00b0 and still nothing. Still nothing. There we go. Oh my gosh. That is That's,00\u00b0 C. It's stretching. I mean, it's still holding up like it's doing a good job. That's 1200\u00b0 C. 1,200. That's a temperature program that stocks and it's still surviving. Still going. But if you push the temperature too far, even this alloy reaches its limits. Cross lit becomes easier. The paired dislocations can now hop between the planes together. And the ordered cubes of gamma prime start to dissolve. So the dislocations break free and it finally gives out. Oh, it may have just uh Did it break? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it did. It broke. But strength alone isn't what makes these alloys special. When you heat up the alloy, aluminum at the surface reacts with oxygen to form a thin continuous layer of aluminum oxide. Unlike the brittle oxides that form on other materials like steel or titanium, this layer stays intact at high temperatures, protecting the metal below. And by adding other elements, we can tune these super alloys. Each one brings a specific property that we want. Most modern super alloys contain as many as 10 different elements, all carefully balanced in their relative abundances for the desired properties. Chromium improves resistance to oxidation and corrosion. Cobalt, titanium, nobium, tantelum, and venadium help stabilize the gamma prime phase. Malibdinum and iron strengthen the gamma matrix. And then there's reinium. Reinium has one of the highest melting points of any metal at 3,180\u00b0 C. It's second only to tungsten. In the nickel super alloy, it slows the atomic scale rearrangements, enhancing the alloys resistance to deformation, even at temperatures above 1,000\u00b0 C. It's one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust at less than one part per billion. And more than 80% of what we mine ends up right here in jet engines. But even with these advancements in No text alloy chemistry, there's still one fundamental problem, and that's that metals are crystalline. Any metal you see from the tip of this ballpoint pen to the spoon in my coffee cup, they're all actually made up of millions of little crystals stuck together. It's kind of like grains in this sugar cube. If I crush it, it's not like I've broken any individual crystal. I've just broken them apart. It's the boundaries between the grains that are the weak point. And it's the same thing in a metal. So if we zoom out from the gamma and gamma prime structure, it looks something like this. One crystal is basically a three-dimensional lattice of atoms all lined up in the same orientation. But the crystals themselves are all in different orientations. So where they meet, their lises don't line up. And that mismatch leaves more open spaces and broken bonds. And you also get defects there like vacancies and impurities. All of which make grain boundaries the weakest point. And this also has another consequence. It makes it easier for atoms to move along the boundaries. They become kind of super highways for atomic diffusion. This becomes even more of a problem at high temperatures when atoms have more energy to move around. Add stress like the massive centrifugal loads on a turbine blade and the grains can actually start to slide past each other. The whole structure slowly deforms, stretching almost like warm taffy. As long as it has grains in it, it will creep and fail far more easily. And that's a really hard problem to solve because normally as a molten alloy cools, tiny crystals start to form all throughout the liquid. No text So you have to find some way to control them. This is one of our furnaces. They're all induction heated. There's no kind of gas fire or anything like that. And they're all under vacuum. So we only cast under vacuum in the absence of any atmosphere, but particularly oxygen, which is obviously metallurgically going to cause us all kinds of problems with oxides. You start by pouring molten super alloy into a ceramic mold that's mounted vertically and heated to about the same temperature as the melt. The mold fills from the root up toward the tip. At the very bottom of the mold sits a copper plate cooled by water. Its surface is patterned with tiny grooves that act as nucleation points for the first crystals to start to form. It's here that solidification begins. Then the entire mold is slowly lowered out of the hot zone. So the solidification continues in just one direction. It's a very slow process in the magnitude of hours. Once that's finished, the whole machine will then index round and it will push the completed mold up out of the other side. Oh wow. So our casting temperatures are roughly 1500\u00b0 C. It's kind of at the same temperature now as it would be inside the jet engine. It's absurd. Like you're making the turbine blades at the same temperature that they're going to operate, but like here they're liquid. Now, if we just did that on its own, you'd end up with a blade that looks like this. Here's a directionally solidified blade. And what you can probably see there is the contrast between the grains. These are all different crystals, but they're all running on this axis of the blade, which makes it significantly stronger than an alloy that is cast where all of the crystals are separate from each other. So, those are like individual crystals. Is that these are individual crystals? Yeah, absolutely. So, we're we're looking at at crystals on kind of a macro level where normally we'd be talking about crystals on a micro level. In a rotating turbine, the blade is being pulled along its length. With columnar crystals all lined up along this span, the blade can carry those stresses far more effectively. There are no grain boundaries that cut across the blade, creating weak points for it to crack. But scientists have found a way to do even better. If you introduce a bend in the mold just above the chill plate, something strange happens. The number of columnar crystals that make it through drops sharply. And if you add another bend, even fewer survive. So engineers added a helical passage known as the pigtail here at the bottom of the mold. The pigtail is doing the job to select the single crystal. The spiral is going to choke out every other grain bar one. So we're only going to have one grain that is then going to grow through the entirety of that blade and cast that blade as a single crystal. Or at least that's the theory. That's crazy. So this is a starter attached to a spiral that we've etched so that we can reveal that structure. So you can see down at the bottom we are starting to grow directionally solidified grains. But as we get up here we can start to see that we're growing directionally solidified grains. And then as we're going up the spiral the grains are starting to be choked out by the upper surfaces of that spiral until when we get to the top we're just as a single crystal. And then that then allows that to grow right the way through the blade. That's amazing. And what we should end up with is a blade like this. So this is a blade of a single crystal. It's a really impressive thing to look at. The shimmer is beautiful. Yeah. Even after the blade solidifies, it's still not ready for the engine. It's heated again almost to its melting point. And that might sound risky because we've spent all this time making sure it's a perfect single crystal. But this heating step lets the atoms shuffle around just enough to spread out evenly and form the final desired microructure of the gamma and gamma prime phases that make these super alloys so strong. And as if casting as a single crystal is not enough actually the orientation of that crystal is also of paramount significance. So you may have cast this as a single crystal, but if the crystal orientation is is off by a certain amount, you get completely different stress responses within that blade. Today, after decades of development, over 95% of blades can be cast successfully as single crystals. Just think about how incredible that is. We've gone from a turbine blade that contained on the order of 50,000 crystal grains down to just one. When we grow these things, they don't solidify as a uniform front. On a microscopic scale, the solidification front looks like a forest of tiny treelike branches called dendrites that are pushing their way into the liquid. At first glance, it looks messy, like millions of separate trees jostling for space. There are up to 10 elements in there, each with its own density and melting point. Yet somehow every one of those trees is locked into the exact same crystal lattice. So the final crystal is comprised of more than six * 10 the 24 atoms. That is more stars than there are in the observable universe. And all these atoms are repeating the same pattern perfectly aligned from root to tip. This completely transformed what jet engines can do. Single crystal blades can withstand stresses and temperatures that would destroy ordinary alloys. They last up to nine times longer against creep and thermal fatigue and are more than three times more resistant to corrosion than blades made from multiple grains. That's why modern jet engines can now run for 25,000 hours between major overhauls. Something that would have been unthinkable before single crystal blades. And the impact has been huge. Between 1960 and 2010, jet aircraft became about 55% more fuel efficient. And a huge part of that improvement comes down to advances in these nickel super alloys. Back in the 1960s, flying was a luxury few could afford. A one-way flight from New York to Paris would set you back $310, which is about $3,750 adjusted for inflation. But as engines became more efficient, able to handle hotter cores and equipped with much larger fans, airlines could carry more people farther using less fuel. So tickets got cheaper and air travel exploded. Today, at any given moment, there are roughly 10,000 to 14,000 planes in the sky. That scale of movement is possible because of these turbine blades. In the furnace, the nickel super alloy outperforms all the other samples, surviving up to,200\u00b0 C. But wait, that's No text still 300\u00b0 less than the temperature inside a jet engine. So why don't the blades melt? Well, there are two final layers of defense. The first is built into the shape of the blade itself. We then have to leech the core out. So we do that in a in a costic solution of potassium sodium hydroxide um under under pressure and temperature to leech the core out. That will leave those core passages uh completely empty and those passages are the real secret to the turbine blade survival. So as the air is flowing through it is turbulent and as such it can remove much more heat from the surface of the blade. Yeah. Than is it these ridges here that we're talking about? Yeah, these ridges here. and they're intentional to trip the trip the flow trip and turbulate that air flow so that it's removing as much heat as possible from the metal. So then we get on to the really juicy part which is film cooling. So we talked about the ice cube in the oven stat keeping our blades as cool as possible. So this is where we start to drill in what we call film cool holes. And what we're aiming to do is we're aiming to get into those cooling passages. So we saw that core earlier on. They are the cooling passages inside. And these holes have got to get right into those cooling passages to allow the air to come out. And the air is then going to blow as a film over the surface of the blade, a film cool hole to create a film of air which is preventing that metal from from melting in those temperatures. This cooling air isn't exactly cold. It actually comes from the high pressure compressor section of the engine at around 600\u00b0. But that is cool enough to help keep the blades from melting. But it's still not quite enough. And you can't just add more cooling air because every extra bit of air you use from the compressor you lose from thrust and actually make the engine less efficient. So every turbine blade is also coated with two protective layers. First, a thin metallic bond coat that resists oxidation and then a ceramic top coat. Even though it's only about a quarter of a millimeter thick, this ceramic coating can keep the metal beneath it 100 to 170\u00b0 cooler than it would otherwise be. And this is the final barrier that stops the blades from melting. So now we've got this insane piece of engineering that can survive the 1500\u00b0 gas, the intense load, and the oxidation problem should be solved. Well, it would be except for one thing. At 36,000 ft, you wouldn't believe this, but there's dirt and dust in the atmosphere that our engines are ingesting. The dirt and dust comes in, it sticks on the blades, but it also goes through the whole cooling circuit and it blocks the cooling from getting through to cool the blades and then the blades burn up. Usually, every time I get on a plane, I'm thinking this is never going to work. No, I mean it's incredible how an engine can work cuz there's so many moving pieces. There's so many parts. The environment's so terrible. And now we have this dust and dirt which is really bad. I am at test bed 80 and they're about to No text fire up this jet engine and then throw dust into it. The same stuff that makes up sand and volcanic ash. Exactly what real engines encounter in flight. So this engine is the 97K. It goes on the A350 and is our higher thrust version of that. So 97,000 pounds of thrust is what this engine's producing. When we're running a an engine like this, we try and carefully recreate exactly what happens in service. [Music] How much dust goes in the engine? Not very much. Um it was surprising when I found out exactly how much we put in. It's in the order of tablespoons worth per cycle. Start master on. Condition power on. Master fuel lever on. Start request in three, two, one. Now, so what does the dust actually do inside a jet engine? So, once it gets through to the hot section of the engine and hits kind of turbine blades, it's going to be melted. And so, uh, it sticks to the outside of our turbine components and it slowly rips layers of that, um, thermal barrier coating off and then you lose your, uh, temperature reduction that comes from the barrier coating. So, your nickel alloy underneath it gets hotter and hotter and that's when starts to deteriorate the turbine. That's why engineers at Rolls-Royce are still refining these blades, developing new ceramic coatings designed to resist molten dust and extend the life of the turbine by up to 30%. That's just the latest step in a story that's been unfolding for decades. These blades have been refined and perfected to the point where they operate right at the edge of what is physically possible. You're always on a knife edge, pushing every material, every process to the limit to build an engine that can do the seemingly impossible, run hotter than its own melting point. The more I learned about the brutal environment these blades have to survive, the more it felt like they shouldn't work at all. And yet, they do. Every day, these machines carry millions of people across the world, and we barely stop to think about them. They're a monument to human ingenuity. What happens when we refuse to accept limits? When we turn the impossible into the routine. I can't grow a single crystal turbine blade in my kitchen, but with the help from this video sponsor, KiwiCo, I can grow a crystal garden with my kids. This month, they sent us their crystal garden chemistry kit. We set everything in place, mixed up the chemical solution, and then watched as colorful crystals started to bloom over the next 48 hours. Every few hours, my kids would run back to check how much the garden had grown. They were totally fascinated, and it sparked so many questions about crystals and atoms, how things arrange. Pretty soon, we were talking about how metals are crystallin, too, and setting ourselves the challenge of growing one giant crystal turbine blade style. I love how simple KiwiCo makes this. Everything we needed came right in the box. So, we could just open it up and dive straight in doing the experiment. And it's not just chemistry. They've got crates for robotics, engineering, art, design techniques, and so much more. There is something for every age and interest. KiwiCo crates also make a great gift for the holidays. It's creative, hands-on, and gives kids something they can actually make and be proud of. They're kind of messy and like hard to make, but not too hard, but hard enough to make it fun.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: science behind rainbows"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So pretty... The other day my son asked me why Rainbows are curved and I could have given him a simple explanation but instead I made this video with beautiful demonstrations I've never seen before this is the perspective of a rainbow from a single raindrop and the best animations ever created on the subject because I promise you almost every explanation out there -double rainbow- is an over simplification For example if raindrops spread white light into colors like a prism then why do you never see a rainbow when looking in the direction of the Sun or why is it darker above a rainbow than under it how can you make a rainbow disappear with sunglasses what's going on here why is this rainbow so much smaller than usual and how did this phenomenon directly lead to a Nobel Prize oh yeah we're going deep on on this one because the full explanation is so much more satisfying than anything you've seen before to make a rainbow you need three things raindrops the Sun and you an observer okay this is one of those experiments that seems so simple but I've never seen anyone do it before I have a glass sphere and that represents my raindrop because as we've learned in previous videos raindrops of course are essentially spherically shaped just preparing the particulate so that I can see the laser beams over here I have a laser and that laser beam represents a ray from the sun rays of light from the sun reach a raindrop essentially parallel to each other because the sun is so far away when light strikes the sphere some of it reflects back off the front surface and some is transmitted into the sphere then at the back again some of the light reflects off the back surface and some is transmitted every time light goes from one medium into another some of it will be reflected and some transmitted and exactly how much depends on the angle of the light its polarization and the nature of the two media this is actually helpful here because I can use the reflections to make sure the laser is lined up properly I think I've got this red laser lined up so it's hitting the middle of the sphere and it's reflecting here but some of the light goes through and some of the light reflects to the back surface and then some of the light goes through to the wall now I'm going to keep the laser horizontal and move it up the sphere so let's call the distance from the central axis the impact parameter as I move the laser up the reflection off the front surface goes up it's just bouncing off that curved surface and I can tell you this is a simple boring reflection nothing interesting happens with it it's not involved in rainbows so it's there but we're basically going to ignore it for the rest of the video what's much more interesting is the reflection off the back surface now here comes that Ray here the spot is on the table as the laser moves up it goes down in fact the whole beam inside the sphere bends down that's because as the light enters the sphere it slows down and so it refracts but why does light slow down when it enters a dense medium like glass well I think a lot of people can tell you that light is an electromagnetic wave without really thinking about what that means you know the electric field around a charged balloon that pulls on your hair or makes it stick to a wall and the magnetic field around a bar magnet that makes iron filings line up well light is what happens if you could rip the electric field off the charges the magnetic field off the magnet smush them together and send them out traveling through space sort of I mean in practice electromagnetic waves are made by accelerating charges like by wiggling them up and down then the changing electric and magnetic fields they create team up as light and head off on their own the clearest explanation I know of for how light is slowed down in a medium comes from Grant over at 3 blue one brown I asked him if I could summarize his explanation for this video and he graciously agre greed so when those electromagnetic waves encounter charges in a medium like those in the first layer of our sphere the light pushes them back and forth you can think of each charge as a little Mass on a spring and the changing electric and magnetic fields cause it to vibrate at the same frequency as the light but now you have wiggling that is accelerating charges so they too must create their own electromagnetic waves and the net electromagnetic field is just a sum of the incident wave plus this new wave the result is almost exactly like the original wave except it is shifted back slightly it receives a phase kick and each layer of the material adds another phase kick so the net effect of all this is the wavelength of the radiation decreases in the new medium and since the frequency stays the same a shorter wavelength decreases the speed of light through the material the speed of light in a vacuum divided by the speed of light in a medium is called the refractive index it's around 1.5 for glass and 1.33 for water so when light enters a new medium at an angle the part of the wave crests that enter the new medium first slow down first and this changes the angle of all the wave crests and since the direction of a beam of light is perpendicular to the wave crests this means the light changes Direction so to recap light causes charges to wiggle so they create their own electromagnetic wave which gives the light a phase kick shortening its wavelength which slows it down and so it bends there's a simple mathematical expression that relates the angles of incidence and refraction to the indexes of refraction of the two media it's known as Snell's law even though it was independently discovered by a handful of people some well before Snell [Music] and this is what we're seeing in the sphere the higher the laser hits the sphere the larger the angle of incidence and hence the more it bends down due to refraction most of this light exits out the back of the sphere but some of it is reflected and it's this reflected ray that we can see coming out the front of the sphere below the incident beam now I want to graph the angle of this reflected ray as I move the beam up the sphere when the laser is dead center the reflected beam comes straight back at the source so let's call that 0\u00b0 then as I move the laser up this angle increases so the light's coming back at 5\u00b0 then 10\u00b0 and it keeps increasing the higher I go but now we come to the critical point watch this spot on the table as I move the incident beam up this dot is moving in the reflected ray is coming closer and closer and closer but there's a certain point right there where it stops coming closer look at that and even as I keep moving this beam higher and higher it doesn't get any closer and then it goes back the other way so what we're seeing there is a maximum angle this reflected ray reaches before it turns around and goes back the other way and this is really important it means that over a range of impact parameters a range of heights of the laser the reflected beam comes out at essentially the same angle which means the light is becoming concentrated at that angle and a concentration of light rays is called acostic curved surfaces all tend to create cosics from coffee mugs to glasses or even just Rippling water cosics create the light patterns we see by concentrating light rays in the case of red light through a sphere of water the maximum scattering angle and hence this CTIC always occurs at 42\u00b0 below the horizontal since my sphere is made of glass rather than water well the angle is different but the principle is the same now you might ask why does this reflected ray reach a maximum angle and then turn around well the answer is just geometry as I move the laser up the sphere although the ray refracts down the point on the back of the sphere where it reflects continues to move up until you get to this special point which is about 7/8 the radius of the sphere and here the angle of incidence is so steep that the refracted Ray stops hitting the back higher and starts hitting it lower that is why the reflection turns around and therefore we get a maximum scattering angle and the concentration of light rays at that angle but the precise maximum scattering angle depends on the color of light to see why let's go back to the idea of the charges in the sphere as masses on Springs they have a natural frequency a frequency at which they would oscillate if not driven at any particular frequency and in most materials this natural frequency is pretty high much higher than the frequencies of visible light now when light pushes a charge back and forth the amplitude of the resulting vibration depends on the difference between the frequency of light and the natural frequency of the charge the closer the two frequencies are the greater the amplitude of the resulting vibration which makes sense if you've ever pushed someone on a swing the closer your pushing frequency is to the natural frequency of the Swing the higher they'll go this means that higher frequency light like blue light will cause the charges to wiggle with greater amplitude and because of this the charges produce higher amplitude electromagnet itic radiation which creates a bigger phase kick which shortens the wavelength proportionally more making higher frequency light travel slower and bend more than lower frequency light all right I'm going to change lasers so when I repeated the experiment with green light it refracted more than red light and therefore the Green Dot turned around sooner than the Red Dot there's the minimum deflection for green and it's significantly different than for red in other words its maximum scattering angle was smaller than for red light if the sphere were water it would occur at around 41\u00b0 below the horizontal similarly for blue light the maximum scattering angle approaches 40\u00b0 I do have a specialty laser which is very bright blue but it's very dangerous so we're going to use it very carefully how are we going to use it very carefully Derek that is a good question maybe we're just going to tape it on here [Music] yeah so the blue only makes it to there green to here red to here so it is a pretty serious spread here I think my experiment may be a little wonky honestly I think this one wasn't perfectly horizontal to really see the importance of the CTIC imagine we illuminate the sphere uniformly with red light well more light is going to hit the sphere at higher impact parameters because the further out you go the more area there is so I've adjusted these sections so that they all have the same area then using our graph of the scattering angle you can see where all of this red light will end up after reflecting off the back surface most of it ends up at the maximum SC scattering angle to make this more obvious we can add more light and we can do the same thing for orange and yellow and all of the other colors and this is what gives us the rainbow it's not enough to say that a raindrop spreads white light into its component colors because all of the light that hits closer to the middle is spread too but since the reflections all overlap as they come out the colors mix and produce White again it's only the difference in maximum scattering angles and thetics they produce that gives us the [Music] rainbow so now we know what happens along a single radius of the sphere so what happens if we uniformly illuminate the whole sphere with white light well I blacked out my window and cut a hole just big enough for afternoon sunlight to cover the sphere [Music] you can see there's a circle of white light coming from the reflections off the back of the sphere and then around it there's a ring of rainbow colors come on one raindrop creates a cone of light the inside is all white and the ring around the outside is colored this is the perspective of a rainbow from a single raindrop all these different light rays coming in at different places reflect back off the front surface and the back surface and that reflection off the back surface reaches a maximum angle and for blue green yellow and red the maximum angle is different so the red maximum angle is the furthest that's why it's on the outside here so good so good what I really wanted to see is if I could observe the cone of different colored CICS that produce that ring H you've got to see this color cone you have got to see this I my eye is right in the color cone here I can see the color cone that is so [Music] cool so this is the crazy focus on the back of the sphere if you stick your finger in there it gets burnt very quick ow this thing is a fcal now this really looks like a rainbow but remember this is just the light coming away from a single droplet when you see a rainbow there are billions of raindrops and each one is projecting a rainbow cone back toward the Sun so how does all of this create a single unified rainbow well for your eye to see a color let's pick red in a certain part of the sky then the red costic from a raindrop there must go directly into to your eye and this only happens when the angle from the Sun to the Raindrop to your eye is 42\u00b0 and this explains why rainbows take the form of an arch with a 42\u00b0 Angle now the violet light from these same raindrops passes above or beside your eye so you can't possibly see it but there are raindrops below and inside the Arc of those red giving raindrops whose Violet CICS do intersect your eye they form a shallower angle of 40\u00b0 between the Sun and your eye and of course there are raindrops at all intermediate angles that send you all the other colors of the rainbow so a rainbow really is the ultimate optical illusion from billions of droplets each projecting a rainbow cone you see a single static arch of color but the droplets sending you those colors are constantly changing a single drop as it falls might send to your eye first red then orange yellow green blue indigo and violet and because a rainbow must form an angle of 40 to 42\u00b0 with your eye the center of the arch must be on a line that passes from the Sun through the back of your head so your Shadow is the center of your Rainbow this means no two people can ever see the exact same rainbow in fact your left and right eyes don't even see the same rainbow a rainbow is an optical illusion made unique for each perspective this also explains why in most parts of the world you can only see a rainbow in the early morning or late afternoon not in the middle of the day the higher the sun is the lower the top of the rainbow is and when the sun is more than 42\u00b0 above the Horizon no rainbow is visible from the ground but even when Rainbows are visible you can turn them invisible using sunglasses that is as long as they are polarized light from the sun is unpolarized which means the electric fields of the light are all randomly oriented oscillating back and forth equally in all directions but it just so happens that when the light in the rainbow Ray reflects off the back of the droplet it does so very close to to a special angle known as Brewster's angle at this angle all light with its electric field oriented parallel to the plane of reflection is transmitted so it passes out the back of the droplet and therefore the only light that is reflected has its electric field perpendicular to the plane of reflection this is the light that creates the rainbow this means rainbow light is polarized along the direction of the rainbow so horizontal at the top and closer to Vertical on the sides this is why you can use a polarizing filter to make a rainbow disappear or to make it brighter if you Orient the filter to allow that polarized light to pass through but why is it brighter under a rainbow than above it well this is because the raindrops beneath the rainbow are reflecting all colors of light at you off their back surfaces this is what created the white disc in my glass sphere experiment in contrast the raindrops above the top of the rainbow are not reflecting any light to you off their back surfaces your eye is now outside the maximum deflection angle of all of the colors but if you look up even further sometimes you see a second fainter rainbow with its colors inverted double rainbow so where does this come from well it comes from an additional reflection inside the raindrops now instead of reflecting once off the inside of the sphere light reflects twice these Reflections also create colored cosics though much fainter because light is lost with each reflection if you look at deflection angles this light starts going out the back of the Raindrop so at an angle of 180\u00b0 but the further out light hits from the center the smaller the angle light reflects back at until it reaches a minimum of around 50\u00b0 for red light then it turns around and goes back the other way so between 42 and 50\u00b0 it is dark because no light reflected once or twice inside a raindrop comes out at this angle this is known as Alexander's dark band now there is photographic evidence of third and fourth order rainbows formed after three or four internal Reflections but this light comes out the back of a raindrop so they are the only kinds of rainbows that you could expect to see when looking in the direction of the Sun but they're so faint that conditions would have to be perfect under lab conditions up to 200th order rainbows have been detected but that is not what is going on here this is known as a super numerary rainbow multiple rainbow like bands show up under a primary rainbow but this only occurs when the raindrops are all really small just tths of a millimeter in diameter now the light rays that pass just above and below the primary rainbow Ray end up coming out at similar angles under 40\u00b0 but they travel slightly different distances on the order of a wavelength and because of this those light rays can interfere constructively and destructively producing a series of light and dark bands inside the main rainbow different colors in these super numerary rainbows overlap more than in the main rainbow so they can produ strange colors like magenta a combination of blue and red supernumeraries also offer a clue to how these small rainbows work whenever I saw images like this or even observed this sort of thing from an airplane I wondered how a rainbow could be so small these are known as glories or brocken bows instead of the usual 42\u00b0 these Circles of color are only around 2 to 4\u00b0 wide well the key is that just like in supernumeraries glories are due to interference so they too require tiny water droplets just tth of a millimeter in diameter these are the sorts of droplets you'd find in fog or clouds light that strikes the edge of the drop can go around the back and come straight back at the source you can see that with the laser on the glass sphere but effectively in the presence of parallel light rays tiny little droplets become a ring source of light but for these tiny droplets the distance from one point to all edges of the sphere can vary on the order of a wavelength so take for example the point right out in front of the drop well now the distance to all edges is the same so the light interferes constructively here and produces a bright spot but a little bit off to one side and now half of the light on average has traveled an extra half a wavelength and so we get a dark spot here if you go a little further well now the light has traveled an extra whole wavelength so now the light is arriving in Phase again and we get a bright spot here so we can rotate this around 360\u00b0 and extend it out in all directions and what we get is a fuzzy Bullseye pattern and of course all the different colors of light have different wavelengths and so these Bullseye patterns aren't completely overlapping so when they're super imposed what we see is rings of color now this is just the pattern from a single droplet but just like with a rainbow if you have millions or billions of these droplets they all contribute to produce the same pattern with your Shadow at the center and it was just such a pattern that inspired a Nobel prizewinning Discovery in September of 1894 a scientist named CTR Wilson was visiting an observatory in the Scottish Hills it was then that he observed the colored Rings surrounding the shadow cast on mist or Cloud he recalls that these glories greatly excited my interest and made me wish to imitate them in the laboratory so Wilson invented the Cloud chamber for the explicit purpose of observing glories of course once he discovered the cloud chamber made the tracks of energetic particles visible he aband abandoned his original aim and was later awarded the Nobel Prize but it all started with the mystery of rings of color in the [Music] fog that looks so nice how did you see that so now I hope you know my son why Rainbows are curved and why they're polarized and why they exist at all and even more than that I hope you know why I find such eny mment in learning about our world why it is worth figuring things out for Millennia rainbows have been this blatant challenge held up to us by nature but can you figure this out and it's

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: Gorilla Glass"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(glass smashing) It is the very symbolwe use for fragility. But these days, we expectso much from this material. We want it to be perfectly transparent, scratch resistant,thin, and even flexible. But most of all, we want it not to break. So is it possible tomake unbreakable glass? Well, in this video, I will make the case that glass is one of themost important materials humans have ever made. It has transformed how we live, launched numerous scientific revolutions, and forever altered how we think about our place in the universe. Part of this video was sponsored by Saily. In mid 2006, Steve Jobs had a problem. Apple was working on the first iPhone, set to be released in January 2007. But Jobs wasn't satisfied with the screen. The prototypes he wastesting had plastic screens, which scratched easily. So Jobs wanted glass, butregular glass wouldn't work. It too would get scratchedup and it would also shatter. Plus, he wanted the phone to be slick, so the glass had to be really thin. So he called up the CEOof Corning, Wendell Weeks, to ask him to make the glass for Apple. And six months later, itwas on the first iPhone. This was Gorilla Glass. Gorilla Glass has beenused in phones, computers, and wearable devicesfor the last 17 years. Now it's used on billions of devices, and over the years it'sbecome a lot more durable. So we sent Veritasium producer, Petr, to Corning's headquarters, to see for ourselves howGorilla Glass is made and how it works. We'll need a volunteer. [Petr] Yeah, guess that's me. [Demonstrator] All right,so this is what we call our key scratch demo. In here we have a polycarbonate, which is basically a plastic, and then we have the Gorilla Glass. And what you can do isscratch this side first, the polycarbonate, see how it goes. [Petr] Yep, definitely scratches. Yep.- Try to scratch in our logo. Not quite.- There you go. [Petr] Are we getting it? Veritasium. [Camera Operator] Yes. [Petr] All right. [Demonstrator] So now try the same thing on the other side. So this is Gorilla Glass. [Petr] Yeah, definitelydoes not scratch. [Narrator] To breakglass requires two things, a flaw and stress. To introduce the flaw,they sandblasted a spot in the middle of the glassto roughen up its surface. And Petr will apply the stress. [Demonstrator] Take that tipand put it inside that circle and push down. See if you can break it apart. Not too hard, right? [Petr] No. [Demonstrator] Allright, so next we have strengthened soda lime. Strengthened as much asyou can for soda lime. So, all right. (glass cracking) [Petr] Harder, for sure. Harder, a little bit? Next we have Gorilla Glass. [Petr] I'm kind of terrified. Oh, Man. (laughing) I know like wedon't actually want to do this, but I want to do this. So. (Petr grunting) Are you kidding me? There's two responses. The first response is either, \"This is a really great demo, I completely understandwhat you're showing me.\" The second response is, 'I'm taking this personally, and I need to try to break this glass.\" Okay. It is a very good demo. I'm like genuinely reallyimpressed at this point. I still want to break the glass. Right, last one. No. Like, I'm bending the stylus. Okay, amazing Glass has existed innature for billions of years. It's formed by meteorite impacts, lightning strikes and volcanic eruptions. But when humans came along,they found ways to use glass. Obsidian is volcanic glass. It forms when lava cools quickly. It's extremely brittle, so when you hit it with another rock, you can chip off sections of it to make a sharper and sharper edge. There's evidence of obsidian being used for cutting implements,arrowheads and tips of spears, as early as 1.2 million years ago. And it hasn't gone out of fashion. Today, some surgicalscalpels have their tips sharpened to just three nanometers across, and the best material forthis purpose is obsidian. Compared to the million plusyears we've been using glass, we only started making it very recently, around 5,600 years ago. Most common glass is composedmainly of oxygen and silicon. The two most abundantelements in Earth's crust. In nature, you find themin the form of quartz, crystalline silicon dioxide. Crystalline means thatthe atoms are arranged in a regular repeating structure, and quartz is the primaryconstituent of sand. So if you take some sand, heat it up to about 1700degrees Celsius until it melts, and then rapidly cool it, it forms glass. During the rapid cooling process, the atoms don't have enough time to return to their periodicallyarranged crystal structure. So instead they are stuck where they are, like a liquid that's beenflash frozen in place. That is why glass isconsidered an amorphous solid. Amorphous just means disorganized, not in any regular arrangement. But perhaps this is wherethe misconception about glass being a liquid comes from. It isn't a liquid at room temperature. Glass is solid because theatoms are fixed in place. They can't flow past eachother like in a liquid. I even made a video aboutthis nine years ago. They are disordered, but they are solid. This amorphous structure isalso what makes glass so brittle because there's no way for thestructure to relieve stress. When stress is applied to the glass a small crack will format a flaw on the surface. And as the glass cracks, the stress is applied toatoms with fewer neighbors. So the crack grows bigger, which eventually leadsto the glass fracturing. [Demonstrator] So nextwe'll move to what we call the slapper demos. What we're using is sandpaper. This represents like anasphalt type surface. Sure. So if you were to get outta your car and you accidentally dropyour phone in the parking lot. And what we're using is this fixture. It's bending it. Mm hm.- So it's pre-stressing it. You have our rough surfaceto introduce the flaw. And on here we have an alternative glass. Similar to some of the competitive stuff, different things on the market. And when you're ready, you can drop. On three, two, one. (glass clanging) Some sounds. Okay.- Right. So it broke.- Not what you wanna see when you pick up yourphone off the parking lot. [Petr] No. Heartbreak. And then we have the Gorilla Glass and what we call the mega slap. All right, very exciting name, right? Now you can see me dramaticallyincrease the height. Shall I do it from here? Nope, from...- The very top? From the very top.- Okay. So, we're not just increasing the height, we're also starting from way up here. Right.- All right. Three, two, one. (metal clanging) No, we're good. That's pretty cool. (gentle music) While, the basic recipe for glass involves silicon dioxide, glass makers have beenadding other ingredients to change its propertiesfor thousands of years. Adding sodium carbonate,also known as soda, and calcium oxide, also known as lime, lowers the temperature atwhich it becomes liquid from 1700 degrees Celsius to around a thousand degrees Celsius. And that's why soda limeglass accounts for around 90% of all glass manufactured today. Another recipe includes adding boron trioxide to the mixture, forming a borosilicate glass. Glass is usually quite sensitiveto changes in temperature. If you throw boiling wateron your car's windshield, it'll likely shatter due tothe glass rapidly expanding. But borosilicate glass has a really low coefficientof thermal expansion. It doesn't grow or shrink very much, even with drastic temperature changes. So it's often used forlaboratory glass, like beakers. [Group Member] Let's go. (bystander laughing) If you want to grab a pairof these screen glasses too? [Petr] Yeah. [Camera Operator] Oh yeah. I can't see anything. [Narrator] And whilethis specific recipe for Gorilla Glass is secret, it is based on a combination of silicon, aluminum, magnesium, and sodium. And the recipe keeps changing. The scientists are constantlytrying different formulations to find more durable andscratch resistant glasses here. This is so cool. Do you ever feel like a pizza chef? (group indistinct chattering) (Petr laughing) (group indistinct chattering) (light upbeat music) [Narrator] This facility is actually where thatexperimentation takes place. (light music) The earliest human madeglass was likely an accident. People have been workingmetal for thousands of years before they made glass. So it's thought thatsome sand made its way into metal working furnaces,forming small glass beads. But soon glass makingbecame its own art form, to make decorations, ornaments, statues, tableware and containers. Unlike clay, glass isimpermeable to water, making it an ideal materialfor bowls and bottles. But then glass makers noticed that by adding otherelements into the mix, they could change the color of the glass. By adding cobalt oxide, you would get a vivid blue. Adding cuprite makes red. But all of the historicalglasses we've been talking about have been opaque. Which is not really whatwe think of as glass today. After glass making was invented, thousands of years passed before we invented transparent glass. That's because making it isactually pretty difficult. (light bright music) The first step came around a hundred AD, when glass makers in Alexandria added manganese dioxide into the mixture, which led to a semi opaque glass. It definitely wasn't transparent, but it did let some light through. This is when glass beganbeing used for windows. And glass windows were a huge deal. I mean, they provide a physical barrier that keeps the warm air in and the wind and critters out, while still allowing lightto shine into your home. But the first truly transparent glass was made many centuries later, around the Italian city of Venice. The art of glass making was thriving and bringing a lot of money into the city. (cash register dinging) There was just one problem. To make and manipulate glassyou need very hot furnaces. And at the time, Venice was a city built almost entirely out of wood. So yeah, glass makers were bringing a lot of money into the city, but they also keptaccidentally burning it down. So in 1291, the governmentof Venice had had enough, so they moved all the glassmakers to the island of Murano. The island became knownas the Isle of Glass, celebrated for making the most beautiful and intricate glassware anywhere on earth. This is also where the glassmaker, Angelo Barovier, invented clear glass. He took some seaweed rich inpotassium oxide and manganese and burned it to create ash. Then he added this ash into his glass. And when it cooled, he foundthat the glass was transparent. Most materials are opaquebecause when photons hit them, the photons are absorbed. The photon excites an electron, pushing it up to a higher energy level. But this only happenswhen the photons energy matches the energy of anallowed electron transition. And different materials havedifferent energy levels. In transparent glass, the energy required to move an electron from a lower state to a higher state is higher than the amount of energy that a photon of visible light has. So the photon just passes right through. Now, while glass istransparent to visible light, it does interact with other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. It absorbs much of theultraviolet spectrum, because UV photons have more energy. Hence, they can push the electronto the higher energy level and be absorbed. That makes it opaque to UV. This is also how colored glass is made. You add impurities into the glass, which affects the electron energy levels, which then changes the color of the glass. If you look at a pane of glass side on, you might notice thatit looks slightly green, which is because the mostcommon glass used for windows, soda lime, has impurities of iron oxides, which give the glass a green tinge. The glass absorbs more of the other colors than it does green. So that's why we see it. I think the only way we truly appreciate how important transparent glass is would be if all of asudden it disappeared. So your windows, glasses,screens all gone. But there is anotherelement in our daily lives that we take for granted,which is connectivity. I mean, we are alwaysconnected to the internet, and losing that connection, even for a few minutes, canbe pretty uncomfortable, especially when you are traveling.

(light upbeat music) Truly transparent glass was a massive deal for three reasons. Sometime in the early1300s, in northern Italy, this clear glass wasground, shaped and polished into small discs that were thicker in thecenter than at the edges. Due to their resemblance to lentil beans, they became known as lenses. Glasses to correct farsightedness didn't seem all thatimportant at the time, because literacy rates were so low, they were almostexclusively used by monks. But after the invention of theprinting press, circa 1440, glasses became a vital tool. The printing press ledto a precipitous drop in the cost of producing books, which led to a rapidincrease in literacy rates. Now a large number of people became aware that they were farsighted. Thankfully, there wasa technology available to solve the problem. 150 years later, a father and son, Hans and Zacharias Janssen, put two lenses in line with each other, rather than side by side. And this was likely theworld's first microscope. It made objects appear about20 times their original size. In the 1660s, Antony Van Leeuwenhoek madesignificant improvements on the microscope, bygrinding the lenses himself. He could magnify things 200 times, allowing him to see human cells. A few years later, RobertHook published \"Micrographia,\" a book full of beautiful sketchesof the microscopic world. And all of this was possiblebecause of transparent glass. And in 1608, Hans Lippershey,an eyeglass maker, applied for a patent for a spy glass. His idea was for it to be used in warfare to spy on your enemy on the battlefield. The next year, GalileoGalilei heard about his idea and realized that he couldpoint this device toward the sky to study the stars and planets. Galileo's telescope magnifiedobjects in the night sky by about 30 times. In 1610, he was able to see he craters of the moon indetail, the phases of Venus, and four of Jupiter's largest moons. These observations were thefinal nail in the coffin for the geocentric model of the universe. He saw moons that were clearlyrevolving around Jupiter and not the earth. And how else could youexplain the phases of Venus, other than to say that theplanet must go around the sun? None of this would've been discovered without the inventionof transparent glass. Four centuries later,we can now make glass that is orders of magnitudemore transparent than water. Glass that is so transparent, that if you were able to make a column as deep as the Mariana trench, you'll be able to see allthe way to the bottom. This is the glass inside optical fibers. Oh, this is getting real. I'm stoked. (camera operator laughing) [Narrator] But themain thing we all need is durable glass. So how do you take a substance that is typically delicate and brittle and improve its scratchresistance and drop resistance? First you start with analuminosilicate base, and then after the glass is made, you submerge it in apotassium salt solution at 420 degrees Celsius. [Petr] It really does look like water. [Camera Operator] Doesn't it? Yeah. I don't know if I want to drink it. [Narrator] Potassium and sodium are chemically very similar. I mean, they both have oneelectron in their outer shell. So during this process, some of the sodium atoms arereplaced by potassium atoms in the glass. Now, potassium atoms are physically larger than sodium atoms, but the glass is already set. It's rigid, so itdoesn't increase in size. So now there's the larger potassium atoms all squeezed together, taking up the same amountof space as before. This increases the compressive strength in the surface of the glass,which makes it more durable. [Camera Operator] Can yousee any visual difference of size between them? Honestly, no. I have two pieces of glass. One of them has gone throughthe ion exchange process. The other one hasn't. I don't know which one is which. And we're gonna figurethat out really soon. You guys ready? Three, two, one. (glass shattering) Okay. (camera operator laughing) That was really cool. (glass clanging) Shall I hit it harder?- Yeah. (glass clanging) Yeah, that was a thunk. My mind is genuinely blown. That's really cool. That's all just like ion exchange, right? That's all just... There's no other difference, right? Yeah.- You put it in a bunch of salt.- Yep, for a few hours, and voila.- For a few hours. Yep.- Ah. I'm trying to think ofa good analogy for this. You know, I can imagine if there were just a whole bunch of people sort of standing around casually and you try to run through them, you'd probably be able tobounce through a few of them, break through the crowd. But what if instead, all of those peoplewere squeezed together, shoulder to shoulder, you know, like people trying to getinto a subway or something. If you try to run through them, all of those forces are justgonna add up and prevent you from getting in or frommaking a dent, making a crack, anything like that. (light groovy music) But the scientists at Corning are constantly tryingto refine the process, to make the glass even more durable. There is a whole team at the facility that is dedicated to testing and measuring different glass prototypes. [Petr] Alright, we're displacing it by one and a half millimeters.- Yep. [Petr] Two millimeters. (glass cracking) Well. [Narrator] And they reallyput glass through its paces. Conducting bendingtests, scratching tests, and dropping heavy steelballs onto the glass. [Demonstrator] Three, two, one. (metal clanging) [Narrator] They also have replica phones with different glasses for the screen. And they drop them fromever increasing heights. But we can go up a little bit and maybe-- Right. We can imagine that I'm taking a selfie. [Narrator] All of this is to make the next version of GorillaGlass even more durable than it already is. Like, are we doing this? If you want to.- Hell yeah. (machine whirring) 1.7 meters. That's roughly selfie height. Three, two, one. (glass clanging) Amazing.- Go down and pick that up. Still good.- Still survived. [Petr] Dude, that's pretty wild. You know, I think it's rather ironic, that we are making this video right now, while my phone looks like this. Can you see those? Yeah. So, it's still glass, it's still cracks. It is not perfect yet. But it is constantly improving, because scientists are working on ways to make this materialmore and more durable. And we have come such a long way. I am just appreciative thatI can have this material. And it is amazing, even if it does still crack sometimes, with people who just refuseto get a case for their phone. (electronic device whirring)"}]}

Amidst the chaos of the trading floor at Singapore's International Stock Exchange, one of the junior traders makes an expensive mistake. Instead of buying 20 futures contracts for a client, she sold them instead, costing Beerings Bank nearly $40,000. To save her job, her boss, Nick Leon, a young trader keen to make his mark, decides to hide the loss. He puts it in an obscure error account. That's account 88888. It's used by banks to solve small discrepancies in trades. It's a dangerous move and it should have been picked up by the central office immediately. But when nobody from bearings notices, he gains confidence, convinced he can win back the loss and get the team out of trouble. I'm operating in the belief that I can get it back. You know, maybe it goes back to the confidence thing. I don't know. I mean, I'm confident I can get it back at that stage. But Leon's staggering overconfidence would create a debt of gargantuan proportions and lead to one of the biggest collapses in banking history. It's easy for me to make the case that overconfidence is the most dangerous of the human biases. Overconfidence gets us into all sorts of trouble. It leads us to take risks, make commitments, enter contests, try things that will ultimately fail, sometimes in costly, embarrassing, and dangerous ways. Overconfidence has been implicated in almost every big disaster, from the sinking of the Titanic to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster to the loss of the space shuttle Challenger. But overconfidence isn't reserved for just a few reckless individuals. We can all fall victim to it. For example, 93% of us think we are better drivers than the median, which is of course impossible. The scale of the problem was identified in some now classic research with a set of simple quiz questions. True or false? Australia is wider than the moon. Oh, I bet they're about the same size. It's just it looks small on a map, but it's huge. Are there more or less stars in the Milky Way than trees on Earth? More stars. more stars. One teaspoon of pure olive oil, 4 1/2 g, contains more chemical potential energy than an equivalent 4 1/2 g amount of TNT. I'm going to say true. Oh no, this feels kind of like a trick question. The energy density of butter is 10 times that of lithium batteries, right? I mean, lithium batteries are rubbish. Everyone's going on about them. Just run your car on butter, I say. True or false? Plants are more efficient than the average solar panel at absorbing the sun's energy. Yeah, they must be. Now, these aren't the exact questions from the original research. More on those later, but the specifics don't really matter. The interesting bit is what they asked next. How confident are No text you that you are right? 100% confident. 100% confident. 100. Yes. I think it's true. Um, so I've also got to go 90%. 100% 100% 100%. Yeah. I don't think we actually had any expectations. This was very early on the re in in the research on on confidence assessment, but we didn't really know what we what what we would find. The results revealed a surprising disparity between how accurate someone thinks they are and how accurate they actually are. When people are 90% certain, they are right only 75% of the time. In fact, we ran our own version of this online and found an even more extreme discrepancy. We asked the Veritassin community a bunch of science questions and then asked how confident they were in their answer. Our results showed that those who were the most confident, describing themselves as 91 to 100% sure, were only correct 51% of the time. Since the original research, these results have been replicated again and again in all areas from general knowledge to motor skills and it affects everyone even experts. I have a paper where we analyze the survey of professional forecasters. These are chief economists at various corporations and banks who are invited to forecast the state of the economy on a quarterly basis. We find that they are on average too sure that they know what's going to happen. So they on average say they're something like 53% sure they have correctly predicted what's going to happen to inflation for instance and they are right like 23% of the time. How well what you think you know matches with what you actually know is called your calibration. So if you're perfectly calibrated and say 80% confident you should be right 80% of the time. But most of us are not well calibrated 100% 100%. Yeah. There are 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, but there are three trillion trees on Earth. 100% confident. 100. Yes. False. Most of the time, being overconfident isn't a huge issue. But for Nick Leon, the stakes soon became very high. Leon's plan to recover his team's loss was to bet that the Japanese stock market would go up. So he went long on the top 225 companies in Japan, the Nikkeay 225. Ever since the Japanese asset price bubble peaked 2 years previously, the Nikkeay had been dropping from 38,000 to 16,000. And he was confident the market would soon bottom out and start rising, but it continued to fall. Over the next few weeks, it dropped to a low of 14,000. And the whole time, Nick was betting the wrong way with ever bigger and riskier bets. He would double down, betting double his losses so the next win would bring him back above water. This strategy should work when the next win comes along, but the market collapse was unrelenting and his losses ballooned from $40,000 to around $3 million. In spite of this, Leon remained confident and eventually his luck turned around. In the spring of 1993, the market rebounded up to 20,000, and by the summer, that account was back in credit. Leon goes out to celebrate that weekend, drinking and dancing on tables, finally free of the hole he had dug himself into. But on Monday morning, he made another trading error on the futures market. A damaging loss that Leon didn't want to admit. So he put the loss back into account 88888. Confident that if he got out of the previous one, he could do it again. He began making risky trades to try to recover that initial loss. And as the losses mounted in the 58 account, it became harder and harder to make new trades to cover the last loss. By the end of 1993, his losses exceeded $30 million. Leon is obviously an extreme example, but this tendency to overestimate our abilities is something we all share. So the question is why? The obvious explanation that a lot of people default to that is we want to feel good about ourselves and pretend like we're wellinformed that we enjoy enormous satisfaction from being able to say I know or even better I told you so. And so uh we pretend to ourselves and others that we know when we don't. That is the the motivated egocentric version of an No text explanation for excessive faith in her own judgment. Reichel had faith and the idea if nothing else. But what if it's something more uncomfortable? Stupidity. France. Reichelt was a tailor with no formal scientific or engineering training. But he was obsessed with solving the problem of aviation safety. He spent months designing a parachute suit which repeatedly failed during testing. But he became convinced the issue was that he didn't have enough height for it to work. So in February 1912, he took it to the Eiffel Tower. And rather than using a dummy to test it, he jumped himself. Tragic, but also really dumb. Do you recognize this graph? Uh the like Dunning Krueger graph. Are you confident that this is the actual Dunning Krueger graph? Not at all. I in fact, I think that this is not the Dunning Krueger graph. I think that this is a bit of a communication trick. This is what people call the Mount Stupid curve, which will pop up if you search for the Dunning Krueger effect into Google images. As far as I understand it, um it's a it's an effect that says that when you know very little about it, your confidence is high. And as you know more about it, your confidence sinks until you become a master at it. But I think that the actual result was No text like a little bit more fuzzy than this. It was this graph doesn't actually show the Dunning Krueger effect. It's just a meme that resonates with a lot of people and it became conflated with the effect. In their original research, Dunning and Krueger tested people on tasks like grammar, logic, and humor and then they asked participants to estimate how well they performed. That produced this curve. You can see that those who performed worse had the largest mismatch between their confidence and performance. They were the most overconfident. Those who performed the best were actually slightly underconfident. This suggests that overconfidence may be linked to how much we know. Those who know less think that they know more than they do. But to me, this effect looks a little like a statistical artifact. Because while I was doing my PhD, I asked students some physics questions and I also asked for their confidence in their answers. And when I looked at the results, accuracy spanned the full range from nearly 0% to 100%. But confidence varied over a much narrower range. All the scores were roughly in the middle. This meant that poor performers were the most overconfident and the highest performers were actually slightly underconfident. This is exactly what Dunning and Krueger found. So maybe overconfidence isn't entirely due to how much we know, but also because most of us express at least kind of middle-of the road confidence. But there is another factor at play No text here, which is how much information our brains are capable of processing. Monday, the 27th of January, 1986. It's 5:45 p.m. at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, and the engineers from Morton Theacle, who made the Challenger Space Shuttle's rocket boosters, make an emergency conference call. They've just seen the weather forecast, predicting temperatures overnight will plummet to 25\u00b0 F, far colder than any previous shuttle launch. They know the rubber O-rings that seal joints in the boosters become less flexible in the cold, but have just a few hours to gather data, create charts, and present their case. Over the next 6 hours, the engineers present 13 charts with data on O-ring temperature, hot gas erosion, joint rotation, and more. But the data is scattered, incomplete, and not synthesized into a clear narrative. They'd never tested below 53\u00b0 F. So NASA managers were trying simultaneously to track historical O-ring data, erosion patterns, joint dynamics, seal resiliency, pressure differentials, and more. No single chart told the whole story. So overwhelmed by seemingly contradictory data and confident that their rocket boosters were safe, theole management overruled their own engineers and approved the launch. At 11:38 the next morning, 73 seconds after launch, all seven crew members were killed. Calibrating your certainty requires thinking of all the ways that you could be wrong. And that's hard for finite fallible agents like us. If it means considering everything that we don't know, how many chunks of novel information you can hold in your head at one time is your short-term memory capacity. In 2008, Hansen, Jesus, and Winman investigated how short-term memory capacity was linked to accuracy and overconfidence. Participants were asked to give ranges for factual questions like the length of a river or the population of a city. People's ranges were consistently too narrow, which effectively meant they were being overconfident. And those who had worse short-term memory were more often wrong and more likely to be overconfident. Another study conducted by Conti in 2023 asked participants to keep sequences of letters in their mind while they judged their own performance. As the memory load increased, confidence estimates became less accurate, even for participants with higher working memory capacities. Together, these studies suggest that assessing your accuracy is a mentally taxing task. So overconfidence isn't necessarily about arrogance. It's your brain working at the limits of what it can track and hold. And because of this, your brain can start using shortcuts. Psychologist Daniel Conorman describes these mental shortcuts as heruristics that together create systemic errors called cognitive biases. One shortcut we use a lot is substituting hard questions with easier related ones. Researchers have tested this by asking students how happy they were in their life and how many dates they'd had in the last month. Unsurprisingly, these two questions did not correlate. There's a lot more to happiness than matches on Tinder, at least for most people. However, if you switch it around and ask about their dates first, suddenly the correlation jumps to 66. Working out how happy you are in your life is a difficult question. You have to consider many things and balance them all out. So, when you're primed with the information about your dating life, you're very likely to substitute that hard question like, \"How happy am I in my life?\" with, \"How many dates have I recently had?\" Overconfidence from misprocessing information like this can be disastrous. So, why are our brains wired this way? I mean, you might expect natural selection to have wiped out the confidently incorrect, but there is evidence that No text overconfidence can actually be advantageous. Overconfidence can massively improve your status. In a scientific version of the apprentice, scientists in 2012 compared participants own assessments of their skill with objective measures. They placed them in group tasks to see who was chosen as a leader and whose ideas influenced the group, tracking status over multiple sessions and assessing whether the desire for status led participants to exaggerate their abilities. The results were clear. Overconfident individuals were more likely to lead, assert themselves, and maintain influence even when their actual abilities were mid. And the evidence certainly shows people react better to confident individuals. Using an fMRI, researchers at the University of Sussex measured brain activity of people after hearing unconfident versus confident advice. Those who listened to the confident advice had increased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. That's a brain region associated with processing rewards and expected satisfaction. This means that human brains are biologically tuned to be influenced by confident individuals. We literally feel better when we hear confident people. But recognizing that dynamic highlights a potentially problematic incentive for anyone who's contending for positions that they want. People who express more confidence in employment interviews or political campaigns, for instance, do earn the confidence of interviewers and potential voters even if they're being overconfident. They can't actually deliver. They don't actually know the answer, but they can talk a good line to impress others even if they can't ultimately deliver on those grand assertions. They know the audience will place more faith in them if they express conf. Well, they should express maximal confidence. No text Leon knew this and he took advantage of it. While he was secretly racking up huge losses in the infamous 58 account, he was publicly posting huge profits and everyone believed the illusion. They come in and they don't test any records. So, I can't be happier. They didn't test one record. As Leon's hidden losses mounted, he requested huge sums from head office to keep doubling down, up to $5 million at a time. Bearing management, barely understanding futures and believing in their star trader, they granted his requests and continued to grant future requests. Every day that I make one of these requests for additional money, I never expected to come. I expect somebody to say, \"Look, what the hell's going on?\" By autumn 1994, the account was nearly $260 million in the red. To mask this, Leon began buying futures from himself, inflating his perceived profits further. At Syax's 10th anniversary in September, Beerings received two awards, largely credited to Leon. In December, he was flown to New York, seemingly responsible for $44 million in Bearings turnover that year. Some traders raised doubts that these kinds of profits could be made from the low-risisk trading he was supposed to be doing. But management's faith in Leon's talent was unshakable, and they dismissed these concerns. Beering's overconfidence in Leon and Leon's overconfidence in himself would be the bank's downfall. The figures are No text so big it seems like the ultimate confidence trick. But there's a partial explanation for the delusion on both sides. Leon's and bearings overconfidence was amplified by the complexity and unpredictability of the market and the trades he was making. It's sort of an issue of feedback. In a controlled environment where there are clear rules and guaranteed outcomes, like in a chess match, there is clear feedback on whether decisions are good or bad. With reliable feedback, professional chess players are able to learn to make better decisions with more accurate confidence. But in a noisy environment where there is rarely consistent or timely consequences for predictions, this feedback is unreliable. Whether our confidence is accurate or misplaced is increasingly hard to judge even amongst experts. It's especially problematic for political pundits. This is going to be a landslide. I think Romney is going to win by quite a bit. So, right now, we have Hillary's about a 75 or an 80% favorite. For example, prior to 2024, political analyst Alan Lickman had accurately predicted the winner of nine of the 10 previous US presidential elections using his 13 keys to the White House method. Using the same strategy in 2024, he predicted that Kla Harris will be a president-breaking president. Look what happened. Is this crazy? He attributed his miscalculation to the spread of disinformation that misled the electorate. This noisy environment made it difficult to discern key issues like the actual state of the economy. No text Similarly, the feedback Leon had received was inconsistent. He was making some bad trades, but he had also won it all back before. and this significantly clouded his judgment, amplifying his overconfidence. By 1995, Leon's losses were in the hundreds of millions, and Bearings had unwittingly sent him $1 billion. For a bank with around $700 million in capital base, they were legally only allowed to lend around a quarter of that. But no one questioned it. They were all blinded by his apparent success. At this point, his positions were so big, he estimates that he was probably half of the entire Nikay futures market. So all he could do was buy himself some time and hope that the market went his way. And for a while it worked. The economy was stable and he couldn't see anything on the horizon that would change this. But then disaster struck. Japan is tonight in a state of mourning and of shock. On the 17th of January 1995, the great Henshin earthquake struck Japan. 20 km from the city of Coobe. With a magnitude of 6.9, it devastated the city which was one of Japan's key ports. This devastation spread to the stock market. The NIK index plunged 1,055 points. Leon attempting to double down again risked even more money. He bet heavily that the Nikay would make a rapid recovery, but it didn't. And in the end, in today's money, Leon had lost $2.8 billion. On the 23rd of February, Leon went on the run. And 3 days later, Bearings, one of the oldest and most trusted banks in the world, collapsed. overconfidence was at least partially to blame for its downfall. Realizing the walls were closing in, Leon fled to Malaysia and then Thailand, but his escape was short-lived. He was eventually arrested in Germany and extradited to face justice, marking the end of a spectacularly destructive gamble. He was just 28 years old. Now, we don't all bring down banks, but No text we are all vulnerable to overconfidence. In a complex world with unclear, noisy feedback where our brains are overwhelmed, a set of simplistic biases can take over and we all too often end up thinking we know more than we do. So, what can we actually do about this? I try to get better at calibrating my confidence judgments by keeping track and keeping score. So, uh, when a colleague asks me, \"How long is it going to take you to get me comments on this paper draft we're working on?\" I don't promise I'll do it by Friday. I'm much more likely to say something like, \"I think there's a 60% chance I can get you comments by Friday.\" They'll often uh react with a quizzical look or uh a laugh. Well, practicing and being aware of our calibration is the obvious way to improve, but so is being intellectually humble. I think that uh the best medicine for overconfidence is not so much information as feedback. Um and I get plenty of that though. I also I I think people are right that sometimes I do have a little bit of overconfidence. If we want to become more accurate, we should capitalize on the wisdom of the crowd by listening more to others. In particular, we should listen to people who disagree with us. Understanding the best arguments of your critics, understanding what information those who disagree with you have that you lack is very helpful for making better decisions. The best calibrated people aren't those who know the most. It's those who know what they don't know. So, true wisdom lies not in being certain, but in knowing the limits of your own certainty. And that's an idea that's inspired our latest project. All those questions I asked. These are good questions. A well, they come from a new board game that we've made. It's called Elements of Truth. The game contains over 800 fascinating science trivia questions with a twist. The number of points you win on each question depends on how confident you are. You can bid any number from 1 to 10. If you're not sure, you can play a low number, or you can try to follow the lead of someone else who you think should know the answer. We've tested this game with scientists, teachers, and students. And what we found is that it regularly leads to discussions that go way beyond the initial questions. The core game comes with 200 questions that cover all aspects of science, and there are five additional packs on specific topics like physics, technology, engineering, and astronomy. Plus, there's a Veritassium pack on concepts covered in many of our most popular videos. We're launching the game through Kickstarter to give you the opportunity to shape it with us. Over the next month, you'll be able to submit questions for a special community pack. This is your chance to etch your name into Veritasium History with a credited question in the game. To reserve your copy and get involved, use this QR code or the link in the description to head over to Kickstarter. It is only because of you that I've been able to make this channel and this game. So, as always, I want to thank you for your support and thank you for watching."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: fascinating history and development of the electron microscope"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And here's what happens if you just keep zooming in: 1,000 times, 100,000 times, 50 million times. Each of these blobs is an actual atom. I saw this the other day at the University of Sydney, and it kind of blew my mind because up until just 30 years ago, directly seeing atoms like this was thought to be impossible. The rooms that you're going to see here are perhaps the most shielded rooms on campus, or even in the whole of Sydney, I would say. And perhaps also the most expensive. That's wild. So why is it so hard to see atoms? Well, you can't actually see atoms with visible light. That's because while light has wavelengths between 380 and 750 nanometers, an atom is still over 3000 times smaller, just 0.1 nanometers. And if the wavelength of light is much bigger than the thing you're trying to see, the light will just diffract or bend around it so you won't be able to see it. So if you want to see atoms, you need something with a much, much smaller wavelength. The best candidate isn't even light. It's electrons. In 1924, a French physicist named Louis de Broglie worked out that everything was sort of wavelike. Not just light, but matter too. Atoms, molecules, even you yourself have a wavelength. And the formula for this wavelength is Planck's constant, divided by the object's momentum, that is, mass times velocity. So here what you actually see, that's the column of the microscope where we accelerate the 300 kV electrons down. 300 kilovolts, these electrons? So they are relativistic particles. How fast are they moving? 99% of the speed of light? Around 80.80% the speed of light? Yeah.So what would be their wavelength? The wavelength is the Planck constant over the momentum, right? So if we calculate that, we come to around between 2 to 3 picometers. Whoa! That's over 100,000 times smaller than visible light. So theoretically, you get 100,000 times more resolution. Shortly after de Broglie's discovery, a group of scientists in Germany started working on a microscope that would use these high-speed electrons. The only problem is you can't bend electrons using glass lenses. So how do you focus them? Hans Busch, a German physicist, suggested that an electromagnetic lens might do the trick. He published his results in 1926, but never actually built one. Fortunately, a copy of his paper fell into the hands of an eager young PhD student, Ernst Ruska. Ruska built his first prototype by coiling up some wire and surrounding it with iron \u2014 taking care to leave a gap in the middle. Then, when he passed a current through the coil, it induced a donut-shaped magnetic field through the metal and across this gap. This was his lens. To test it, Ruska first boiled electrons off a tungsten filament, the same kind of filament you'd find in an incandescent light bulb. He accelerated these free electrons through a positively charged anode down to his electromagnetic lens. As an electron approaches the lens, the magnetic field exerts a force on it. So if an electron is traveling in the y direction and the magnetic fields are in the x direction, this force, called the Lorentz force, pushes it in the z direction. But as the electron moves this way, it encounters other magnetic field lines along the donut shape, which constantly point its motion in a circle. But then this circular motion means the Lorentz force starts pushing the electron inwards as well, spiraling it into the center of the lens. Now, if you trace the path of the whole beam of electrons, you'll see they all get steered into the center, focusing the beam. By 1931, Ruska and his colleague,Max Knoll, used this kind of design to build the first working electron microscope. It was pretty basic, made of brass roughly bolted together, but it worked. The image itself was created once the focused electron beam hit a sample sitting at the focal point. The sample needed to be incredibly thin, only around 100 nanometers thick. More electrons would make it through the thinner parts of the sample than the thicker parts, creating an electron imprint of the sample. Then a second electromagnetic lens magnified this imprint down onto a fluorescent detector, producing the final image. This was known as a transmission electron microscope or TEM. Now, early versions of the microscope barely magnified at all. In fact, it wasn't even better than an optical microscope. But Ruska was determined. Over the next few years, he experimented with adding more lenses onto the microscope to create bigger and bigger images. By the mid-1930s, Ruska had gotten the TEM way past 10,000 times magnification. It could produce close-ups of insects, bacteria, and even viruses at a level far surpassing the optical microscope. But right as Ruska's TEM was taking off, a German physicist named Otto Scherzer published a paper claiming that the microscope was about to hit a brick wall. There was a flaw in the electromagnetic lens, he wrote, that was completely unavoidable. For an electron to make it to the focus of the lens, it needs to be deflected by a specific amount. If you simplify its trajectory, you can define that ideal deflection with this angle theta. This angle depends on the horizontal distance of the electron from the optical axis, and how far down the axis the focus is, also known as the focal length. The shorter the focal length, the stronger the magnification. If you graph this angle as a function of distance to the optical axis, you'll see that it can be approximated as linear. The problem is that the magnetic field doesn't scale linearly. It's much stronger near the edges of the magnet. So if you plot the curve for the actual deflection of the electrons, you'll see that the magnetic field overdeflects the electrons further out. Their angles are bigger than they should be, so they end up focusing before the rays in the middle. And as a result, the focus is spread across the optical axis instead of being contained in a single point. The blur starts out around the edges of the image, but it gets worse the higher the magnification. This is called spherical aberration, and it distorts every radially symmetric magnetic lens. In fact, it doesn't just affect magnetic lenses. Every spherical lens, from a camera to a telescope to a magnifying glass also suffers from it. But there is a surprisingly simple way to minimize spherical aberration. Just add a second lens, one that diverges light instead of converging it. Now, a diverging lens also suffers from spherical aberration. But if it has the same amount of aberration as your converging lens just in reverse, you can stack the two to essentially cancel out their effects. And that removes the aberrations almost entirely. Almost all modern lens systems in cameras and microscopes use some sort of correcting divergent lens. So you might imagine that the TEM simply needs its own version of a diverging spherical lens to magnify further. But with magnets, this is physically impossible. Every magnet has two poles, a North and a South. It's impossible to just have one. Even if you split a magnet down the middle, it creates two smaller magnets, both with a North and South. And all magnetic field lines have to start at one pole and end at the other, forming a closed loop. It's a direct result of the second Maxwell equation because the field that you create has field lines that start and end at the same magnet. So the electrons will always cross through two lines. The first time it passes through, by the Lorentz force, it's brought into the spiraling motion. And then the second time from that spiraling motion, which has then a slightly different direction, it's pushed towards the axis. That's why all electromagnetic lenses by default will converge that beam, and never diverge it. Even if you shot electrons in from the other side of the lens, they would still get focused. This is what Otto Scherzer's paper proved in 1936, stopping progress on the TEM. It is impossible to produce a radially symmetric magnetic lens that diverges. And this was, of course, a big roadblock for the development of electron microscopy, because people saw, okay, we can accelerate electrons as much as we want, the presence of spherical aberration will always be in the way. Because of this roadblock, advancements in the microscope's resolution slowed significantly. By 1955, another microscope beat the TEM to the punch and took the first generally accepted image of atoms. This was called the field ion microscope, and it worked by shooting helium or neon atoms at an atomically sharp needle tip. The tip was positively charged. So when the gas atoms hit the needle, they got ionized and were ejected off perpendicular to the surface. And that could form an impression of the atomic structure of the tip. But this method was limited. You could only get a sense of the atomic structure of the very tip of the needle. And the images weren't all that impressive. Luckily, Ruska's electron microscope wouldn't stay stuck in the realm of insects and bacteria forever. Now, you might not be an insect getting bombarded with relativistic electrons, but it can sometimes feel like it when you're getting bombarded with spam calls and targeted ads.

People tried boosting the resolution with clever workarounds, and perhaps none more so than British-American physicist Albert Crewe. His idea was to replace the tungsten filament, which fired off electrons at random, with a more directed source. So instead of boiling electrons off the surface, he tried pulling them off with a stronger electric field. And, by sharpening the tungsten into a fine tip, he was able to create a narrow beam which was over a thousand times brighter than before. He paired his new narrow beam with an unlikely technology. The cathode ray tube TV. These TVs worked by scanning an electron beam across a screen. The screen was coated in a phosphor that produced light when hit by electrons. And by varying the intensity of the electron beam, you could vary the brightness of the screen, giving you a black-and-white image. Crewe was inspired to design a similar electron beam for the TEM that would scan across the nanoscopic sample. So instead of creating an imprint of the whole sample at once, Crewe's electron beam made smaller imprints, mapping the sample out bit by bit. This wasn't the first time someone had tried to make a scanning version of the TEM. German researcher Manfred von Ardenne built an early prototype in the 1930s, but it was destroyed during WWII. When Crewe revived Ardenne's design, he made several drastic improvements, and by 1970 he had this. The first image of single atoms taken with the electron microscope. Researchers quickly jumped to employ his tech, producing countless images of atoms. After nearly a century of improvements from Ruska, Crewe, and many others, the magnification upgrades on the TEM had reached their peak. But Scherzer's problem persisted. Spherical aberration set a hard limit on how small you could see. Even Crewe himself gave up on trying to get around it after over ten years of work. \"Unfortunately, we could never make it work. After many heartbreaking attempts, we were forced to admit defeat.\" Around this time, other microscopes emerged that could also image atoms. These probe microscopes work by gliding an incredibly small stylus across the sample. The stylus detects variations in quantum effects or nanoscale forces to then map the surface structure of the sample. These were easier to build, and because they didn't use any lenses, they weren't limited by spherical aberration. Their images were even 3D. But the looming issue was that these probes weren't really seeing atoms. It was more like feeling atoms. Throughout the 80s and 90s, this was all we had. But what if there was another way? Scherzer's theorem proof that a diverging, radially symmetric lens isn't possible. But if you're willing to give up on that symmetry, well, the theorem no longer applies. The problem is that radial symmetry is arguably the most important property of any lens, because if you break the symmetry, you also break the image. But three maverick scientists thought there might be a way. Knut Urban, Max Haider, and Harold Rose were known in the electron microscope community as troublemakers, and for years barely anyone had been interested in their research or, more importantly, in funding it. And for a good reason too. Their idea was kind of crazy. I mean, they purposely wanted to break the image using a lens that wasn't symmetric. Their hope was that there would be a small part of this distorted image that would be slightly diverging. And maybe, just maybe, this small part could correct the spherical aberration of the original lens. So they got to work To distort the image, they used a massive nest of electromagnets with six, eight, or even ten separate coils and magnets with bumpy magnetic fields. These were known as the hexapole, octopole, and decapole magnets. So as the electron beam passed through a hexapole, it would twist and squeeze the flat 2D image into a triangular saddle. And the circumference of the original beam would be pushed into the three corners, with the rest of the interior stretched out. But now the middle of the image would have a slight concave bow, giving the effect of a small divergence. Then Rose, Haider, and Urban forced the beam through a second hexapole , one that worked the opposite way, so it would unbend the distorted image back into a circular shape. But now they, calculated this new image might have the remnants of that tiny divergence still in its center, with spherical aberration pointing in the opposite way. So if they got their maths and engineering exactly right, they could feed an image with spherical aberration through these two lenses to almost completely counteract the effect. And I imagine a lot of people in the field thought it was a crazy idea when it was proposed, right? Not only the concept, but, that this is, like, technically feasible, I believe. It was thought that this is not possible. By May 1997, the group had just two months of development time left before their last sponsor withdrew their backing. And to make matters worse, their latest lens iteration was still just on the drawing board. But somehow, by the 23rd of July, just a week before their funding ran out, the new lens was ready to test. They gingerly placed it into the microscope, but like every time before it, the lens was unstable and failed. So they decided to switch off the equipment for 24 hours to allow the magnets to settle. And then at 2 a.m. on the 24th, they turned it on again, and almost magically, the picture started to stabilize. Suddenly, there was no aberration. Only beautiful, clear images of atoms. After more than 60 years of failed attempts, Urban, Rose, and Haider pulled off the seemingly impossible. With this method, they cut the resolution of the TEM down to only 0.13 nanometers. An average TEM image went from looking like this to this. A few months after the group's breakthrough, Knut Urban attended a microscopy conference to share these results. But because of the group's reputation, he was relegated to a small back room that barely anyone noticed. Soon, however, word spread that against all odds, his pictures seemed real. Then a crowd of hundreds formed. People were lining up outside, hoping to get a glimpse of their stunningly sharp images. So we're going to get a sample holder. Yeah, so we got a sample holder out. We put that under the optical microscope. So the sample itself is a small lamella that you can't see without the optical microscope. Yeah.Have a look through that. Beautiful. On top of the B there's a prong. Yeah. And on the very top of that on the left-hand side, looks like a little bit of dust. That's our actual sample. Okay, now I simply go up with the magnification and I do a very few, like, more basic alignments. In this electron microscope because it's called transmission electron microscope, the electrons always transmit the sample. Here we look through our entire sample at the same time. And that's why it's so important that we align the sample. If you imagine atoms in a high-symmetry direction are lined up like pearls on a string. When we look down it, well, we can see an image. But if we are in, like, some random direction that everything would be just blurred. So that's why we have to do some tilting in the edge. And this is where the actual sample starts \u2014 the strontium titanate. And this is a thin region where we hope to get atomic resolution. So this is 5000 times? Yes Wow. And we see strontium, titanium. We see oxygen. We see carbon. That's contamination. So most likely what we're looking at is carbon contamination. When you do this focus, what are you really looking for? I look for this edge to become sharp. See atoms. What? Just like that. That's wild. Shortly after, the group successfully corrected Orndrej Krivanek independently achieved the same for Crewe\u2019s version of the microscope, the scanning TEM. And in 2020, all four were awarded the prestigious Kavli Prize in Nanoscience for accomplishing what so many others thought impossible. Through their persistence and ingenuity, seeing atoms like this is, well, normal. How big of a difference does aberration correction make? If you want to see atoms and if you want to, for example, measure in atomic distances, and if you want to learn what type of atoms you have, you need aberration correction. Any research that's material science. Materials engineering, chemical engineering... You need to see what's happening at the atomic level because you want to relate the properties to the structure. If you can't see the structure at the atomic level, you only have half of the information. So that was a game changer. That's why nowadays every university in principle needs a microscope like that."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: natural rubber"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What happens if I heat up this rubber band? When you heat materials like glass or plastic, the atoms vibrate faster. They get slightly farther apart and this reduces intermolecular forces. So, the material gets weaker. Under tension, it stretches. But when I heat up this rubber band, the opposite happens. It actually pulls more strongly. The rubber band contracts and the weight goes up. So, why does this happen? Well, rubber is unlike any other material. It's waterproof. As it's breaking, it actually becomes tougher, and it can stretch up to 10 times its length and bounce back, no worse for wear. These properties have made it essential for modern life. It forms the tubes and seals that carry our gas and water, the belts that drive our motors, and the tires on our cars, trucks, and planes. Even trains use rubber in their suspension systems. It's a perfectly engineered material, but we didn't invent it. All of our most durable rubber still comes from a single natural source. This tree, it's a source at risk of being wiped out. And if that happens, the results could be devastating. You're talking about a complete global societal meltdown. This could be considered a national security issue. You wouldn't think that we're so dependent on this thing. Well, we are. And most people don't know that. They're waiting for a disaster to happen. Rubber comes from the Brazilian rubber tree. As early as 1600 BC, Mesoamericans cut the bark to release this milky white liquid, now known as latex. They noticed that if they let it dry, it turned into this stretchy waterproof solid lump. To see this in person, we sent Veritasium producer and mechanical engineer Henry van Dyck to the Akran Research and Development Laboratory where they specialize in all things rubber. In just all these racks, even though they look solid, they're all flowing right now. Really? If you look behind one of these racks, you can see these are actually dripping. Oh, wow. They're flowing slower than we can perceive. Unprocessed rubber is not the rubber we're used to. it slowly flows and can't maintain its shape. So, how do you get this weird material in the first place? Well, just underneath the bark are special tube-like cells that carry the latex. Floating around inside are lots of isopentenyl pyrophosphate or IP. This is the building block or monomer of rubber. In fact, IPP is found everywhere in nature, including inside you. Huge amounts of us are dependent upon that little molecule. We we make short chain rubber in our livers. It's called dolichol. You're busily making rubber. You are a rubber factory. How? What do you mean? Why why am I making rubber? Uh it's essential for for cell membranes. Special builder enzymes grab these monomers to build this long chain with over No text 10,000 monomers. They build a polymer. This is rubber. So I get students to think about if this is a carbon atom and then I've got my next carbon atom along the chain next to it. Yeah. And then I've got my next carbon atom. How many do we have to make up the whole length of the chain? Well, we've got tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of carbons along the backbone. You start going kilometers in distance from end to end. If each atom is the size of this tennis ball. But the polymers aren't stretched out from end to end like that. Instead, they're all coiled up. If you imagine the room that I'm in right now and I had the first ball here in the middle, the chances of the end of the chain leaving this room is quite small. So after you've dried out the latex, you're left with raw rubber, a jumble of all these polymers. And this is why it's flowing because over time all those polymers slowly slide past each other. Now when you pull on the rubber and let go, it bounces back. So why is this? At room temperature, rubber's polymer chains are constantly vibrating and bumping into each other. And other smaller molecules like air molecules or trapped water molecules also jostle around and bump into the chains. Now, when you stretch rubber, these chains straighten out. But as you're doing this, those chains are still being bombarded by these smaller molecules. So when you release that stress, there's nothing holding those chains aligned anymore. And the constant bombardment from the smaller molecules and the other chains kinks those chains back up. So the rubber snaps back to its original size. And if you heat the rubber up, well then everything is vibrating faster and so the chains are going to get kinked up even more. So the rubber pulls back stronger. This is why when you heat up rubber, it shrinks. Rubber bands. Fascinating to think that when they sitting on an old package of papers for a long time holding those papers together, it's done by a perpetual pounding pounding pounding of the atoms against these chains to hold trying to kink them and trying to kink them. But there's also another No text reason why rubber is so stretchy. If you zoom in on a chain, you'll see that the monomers are attached to each other on the same side of the double bond. This is called cis attachment and it affects how the chain folds. On each monomer, there are three single bonds that can rotate to be at an angle or in line. But these carbons with two hydrogens take up a lot of space. So, it's favorable for at least one of these bonds to be at an angle. That makes the polymer wiggle in and out like a folded ribbon. So, when you pull on a piece of rubber, first all the polymers line up, but then each chain also unfolds. The wiggle makes rubber extra stretchy. But this state is very rare. All three bonds lined up is only one possible arrangement for any monomer. And one polymer usually has thousands of monomers. So after you release the stress, the chain goes from an improbable state, completely aligned, to a more probable one with wiggles. The chain itself bounces back. This is where rubber gets its elasticity from. So natural rubber straight from the tree is already stretchy. It's also waterproof since all those chains are just a bunch of carbon and hydrogen atoms which are hydrophobic. But as we've seen, it eventually loses its shape. Plus, if you stretch it too much, it breaks quite easily. So, we need to do more to get the rubber we're used to today. Early Mesoamericans improved the rubber slightly by mixing the latex with juice No text from the tropical morning glory, a local flower. And they used this to form sandals, bottles, and balls. But for the next 3,000 years, to the rest of the world, rubber was little more than a curiosity. Then in 1770, a piece of natural latex made its way to English chemist Joseph Priestley, and he took this piece and used it to try to erase pencil marks. He noticed that it easily quote rubbed them away. In the following decades, people started exploring other applications. Up until then, people used to waterproof fabric with oil, wax, or tar. But some oils were extremely flammable and prone to spontaneous combustion, and wax or tar would eventually crack with movement. Similarly, there were no real good flexible materials at the time. Leather was the best option, but it had little give. Rubber had the potential to fix all those problems. So, for the next 50 years, the use of rubber exploded. In England, people made waterproof clothing, and by the late 1820s, the rubber craze hit the US when everyone wanted their own pair of Brazilian waterproof boots. Factories sprang up all across the country to make new rubber products, including one New England factory called the Roxbury India Rubber Company. In the spring of 1834, things were looking great for the company. The previous fall, they had sold over $20,000 worth of goods, rubber coats, shoes, and the like. But as the summer came around, problems started to emerge. They used to rubberize the fabric to make it water resistant, which was fine until you sat down on a wooden bench on a hot day and you stuck to it. See, all natural rubber has a critical weakness. It's extremely sensitive to temperature changes. It melts when it gets too hot, and it freezes and becomes brittle when it gets too cold. This made the coats and shoes practically useless during the hot summer, so customers returned their items on mass. Then things went from bad to worse. One day, the Roxbury manager visited the warehouse. When he opened the door, he didn't see their newest products. Instead, he was met with a foul smell and a molten, gooey mess that covered the entire warehouse. In fact, when we ordered some raw rubber, we were in for a similar nasty surprise. A that is disgusting. The summer heat melted their rubber products and they started rotting. No text The sludge stank so badly the manager had the employees secretly bury it at night. But later in that horrible summer, the manager got a visit from a man named Charles. Charles previous business had gone bankrupt and he was deeply in debt. He stumbled upon a rubber life preserver and he thought he could make a better valve. He pitched the Roxbury manager on his new design, hoping to pay back his lenders. The manager was impressed, but couldn't buy Charles' work. He showed Charles the warehouse full of rotten rubber. Rubber had potential, but in its current form, it was just too problematic. However, he said if anyone could figure out how to make rubber stable in a wider temperature range and non-sticky, well, then that person would stand to make a ton of money. So, Charles was determined to become that person. But when he returned home to start his experiments, he was met by an angry creditor who threw Charles into debtor's prison for unpaid loans. Charles asked his wife to bring him raw rubber and her rolling pin. There, in his jail cell, he started adding different compounds into raw rubber. If rubber was naturally sticky, then why couldn't you add dry powders to absorb that stickiness? So, he tried adding magnesia, and he got a smooth, non-sticky rubber. But over time, the stickiness returned. After his release, he tested the wear and tear of his rubber compounds by walking around in all rubber outfits. His hands were always covered with gum elastic. He playfully said that the only way to rub rubber off was by rubbing more on. Some mixtures showed promise, but eventually they'd all rot into a sticky mess. So he kept borrowing money to fund his experiments. But because his mixtures all eventually failed, he ended up in debtor's prison so many times that he jokingly called it his hotel. But Charles refused to give up. When a friend told him, \"Rubber is dead.\" Charles replied, \"I am the man to bring it back.\" In the summer of 1838, he met Nathaniel Hayward, a businessman and inventor. Hayward had done his own experiments with rubber. At one point, he laid out a sheet of rubber and sprinkled on sulfur powder. And when he let this sheet set in the sun, he noticed that it hardened and had a smooth and non-sticky surface. But eventually, it would still melt in the heat and freeze in the cold. He offered his process to his previous company, but it was so horribly smelly that they rejected it. But Charles saw the possibilities, so he helped Hayward get a patent, and then he bought it so that he could use it in his own experiments. Then one day in the winter of 1839, Charles accidentally dropped a piece of rubber mixed with sulfur on a hot stove. When he went to scrape it off, he found that instead of melting, it had charred and hardened. His daughter later said, \"As I was passing in and out of the room, I casually observed the little piece of gum which he was holding near the fire, and he was unusually animated by some discovery which he had made. He nailed the piece of gum outside the kitchen door in the intense cold. In the morning, he brought it in, holding it up exaltingly. He had found it perfectly flexible as it was when he put it out. So, he had made a new rubber with completely different properties, one that seemed to be temperature resistant and much stronger. In fact, we're going to test out unprocessed rubber against rubber processed in this way. Okay, so this is uncured rubber and I'm going to see how I how far I can pull it. Uncured rubber is very soft and stretches really far before easily breaking. It's going to hurt. We need to cure it. What does it smell like to you? Smells like a barbecue. That smells like a barbecue. The smell of rubber does not seem to be natural. Like it smells very chemically like it was made in the factory. Yeah. So, when I was in the factory and I saw the natural rubber, it smelled just like like a barbecue. The reason is they take the sap from the rubber tree, which is latex, and then they smoke it. They're smoking it? Yeah. Like you'd smoke some salmon? Yeah. They smoke the rubber sheets to get rid of excess moisture and to preserve it by getting rid of the bacteria. This gives most natural rubber a sort of brownish color. So, step one, add the rubber one at a time. Next, you add several powders, including sulfur. Everything is mixed and heated to get a much stronger rubber. Just pull it straight off. That's what Yeah. We pretty tough. It is tough. Now, yeah. Now it's like wicked hard. Yeah. Now, at 393 kilopascals, the unccured rubber broke after extending just under 900% of its original length. At the same stress, the cured rubber had only stretched around 5%. It eventually broke at 14.1 megapascals after stretching nearly 600% of its original length. So, what was it about sulfur and heat that changed the properties so dramatically? Well, chemically, sulfur powder is just rings of eight sulfur atoms. On the hot stove, the sulfur ring broke apart into smaller pieces. And now, those sulfur atoms or sulfur chains have free bonding sites. So they look for places to attach. What likely happened is they grabbed onto a carbon atom from a rubber chain, breaking its double bond and attached itself. Then with another free bonding site, it grabbed onto a carbon atom from a different rubber chain, breaking its double bond and linking the two rubber chains together. This cross-linking forms flexible bridges of one, two, or even more sulfur atoms in a row. Now think about what this does to the rubber. Instead of each chain being loose and slippery like spaghetti, they're tied together in a flexible but connected network. So now if rubber sits out in the sun on a hot summer's day, the tight bonds prevent it from melting. And in the cold, the cross links make it harder for the rubber to fully freeze, so it's less brittle and harder to break. And when you pull on the rubber, the chains stretch just as before. But as you release it, everything returns to its original position because it's all connected. So the cross No text links make the rubber stronger, more resistant to temperature changes, and more elastic. In fact, by tweaking the number and properties of these cross links, you can change the properties of rubber. If you have a lot of cross links, all the rubber chains are bound tightly together, so the rubber becomes harder and stiffer. Great for things like shoe soles and tires that need to be durable, but still a little flexible. If you have shorter cross links, each link is harder to break, so the rubber is more resistant to heat and weathering. This is useful for seals and insulators. And if you have longer cross links, the rubber chains can move more freely, so you can stretch it more before it breaks. That's perfect in the medical field for soft and flexible applications. So, the cross links are essential to stabilizing rubber. When Hayward sprinkled sulfur powder on rubber sheets, the heat from the sun did cause some cross linking, but only on the surface. When Charles kneaded in sulfur and then heated the entire mixture, the cross lengths grew throughout the entire sample. So now the results were much better. Eventually this process was called vulcanization after the Roman god Vulcan who was associated with heat and sulfur in volcanoes. Over the next 5 years, Charles perfected his method of vulcanization and then he patented it in 1844. With this, he transformed rubber from a curiosity into a material of endless possibilities. Little did he know that he actually wasn't the first to discover it. The Mayans or the Aztecs used like created rubber. Were they also vulcanizing rubber or was this the They actually were. In fact, Charles discovery was very similar to what the Mesoamericans have been doing for thousands of years. They'd taken the juice from the morning glory which contained sulfur, mixed it with natural latex, and then by laying it out in the sun, it would heat up and actually naturally create the cross links that he discovered in his kitchen. Why did the Europeans like why did they have to reinvent the whole thing? Why did they just ask? Well, they hadn't even noticed, I don't think. No. In the decades after Charles's invention, tons and tons of products were invented or improved with rubber. Richards makes bold claim he could cross Pacific in this outfit. The inflatable bicycle tire arrived in 1888, the first rubber gloves for medical purposes in 1890, and the first car tire in 1895. And all of this was thanks to Charles invention. But despite almost single-handedly transforming the rubber industry, he never made much money. I mean, he spent thousands of dollars defending his inventions in patent disputes. And when he passed away in 1860 at the age of 59, he was over $200,000 in debt. That would be around 7.7 million today. 38 years later, American entrepreneur Frank Seiberling founded a tire company and decided to name it in honor of Rubber's inventor, Charles Goodyear. Today, the Goodyear Company makes $18.9 billion a year in revenue, and it's the third largest tire manufacturer in the world. For the past hundred years, tires have consumed the most natural rubber out of any application. But vulcanized rubber alone isn't strong enough and would wear down quickly, lasting only around 8,000 No text km. So in the early 1900s, car and tire companies started experimenting with additives, including something called carbon black. Start with natural rubber, we got carbon black reinforcement, which is going to add the cross linking. This doesn't do the cross linking. No, it doesn't. So this is the reinforcement and filler. This makes it durable and resilient. Nowadays, passenger car tires last about 100,000 km. Carbon black is what gives them their color and durability. But carbon black has another benefit. It conducts electricity. That's hugely important because as you're driving down the road, you're charging up the vehicle. If you didn't dissipate that static charge, then you get a shock when you earth the car, when you touch the car. But later, some companies wondered if they could reduce rolling friction by using a different additive. So they tried silica instead, making a whitish looking tire. But silica is a poor conductor and rubber itself is an insulator. So now as the car moved, it would slowly build up charge. As you go to refuel the car, you have a highly charged static electricity charged vehicle. You put an earth conductor, the fuel hose into the tank, you create a spark in the tank, car explodes. There's a very vital uh characteristic of tires is that they should be conductive. The other benefit is if you're in a if you're in a thunderstorm and you're struck by lightning, the lightning will hit the car. It will act as a Faraday cage. It will completely protect you and it will dissipate down to the ground. So, people have stuck to using carbon black for most of the tire and only a little silica in the treads. And since Goodyear's invention, we've made over 70 billion tires. If they were stacked on top of each other, they could go to the moon and back 21 times. And almost all of these tires needed natural rubber. But fueling the rubber boom came at a price, especially early on. In the late 19th century, the Amazon region supplied over 90% of the world's rubber. But wild rubber trees were often separated by hundreds of meters. So to keep up with growing demand, rubber barons began to exploit natives, killing roughly 40,000 people in the Putumayo region alone and likely over a 100,000 across the wider Amazon region between 1879 and 1911. The humanitarian activist Roger Casement said that it was first called India rubber because it came from the Indies and the earliest European use of it was to rub out or erase. It is now called India rubber because it rubs out or erases the Indians. Is one of the most appalling instances of genocide and sickening ill treatment of native peoples. But other countries like England weren't happy with Brazil's monopoly. So in 1876, the biopirate Henry Wickham managed to smuggle 70,000 rubber seeds back to England. The British Empire planted these seeds all over Southeast Asia, which had a similar climate. Only now, instead of having just a few rubber trees here and there, they made farms of acres and acres of nothing but rubber trees. These plantations produced far more than the Amazon. Brazil's share of the rubber supply dropped from over 80% in 1907 to 1.6% at 6% just over three decades later. By the mid 1930s, over 90% of all rubber came from the British colonies in Southeast Asia. And two-thirds of that rubber went into making car tires. One of the largest car manufacturers at the time was Ford, which made an average of 1.5 million cars every year. And Henry Ford wasn't comfortable with England's monopoly. So in 1928 he bought 10,000 square kilometers of land from the Brazilian government to build a utopian town. He called it Fordlandia. It had Cape Cod cottages, a hospital, swimming pools, a golf course, and little red fire hydrants. It was an American city in the middle of the Amazon. It could house 10,000 people, all working to plant millions of rubber trees. Ford Plantation is a successful enterprise, a tribute to skill and science. No text But in the early 1930s, things started to go wrong. Every morning, the workers would wake up, walk to the line of rubber trees, and they'd notice black spots. Just a few at first, little specks on the undersides of the leaves, like flecks of soot. But by the afternoon, they'd spread to cover the leaves entirely. And the next morning, the leaves were falling off. Shortly after that, the tree died. Every day another row of trees was infected and dying. People who've seen it say it looks like a firefront. You have the infected trees and it's green on one side and black on the other. And you see that black line move day by day. You you could virtually watch it move, leaving dead trees behind it. The trees were infected by the South American leaf blight, a fungus native to South America. This blight ruined the 3.6 million rubber trees from Ford's plantations by the early 1940s, turning it into a disaster. When planting his rubber trees, instead of separating them by hundreds of meters like they were in the wild, he planted them several meters apart, 200,000 of them. They're all touching. The roots are touching, the leaves are touching, the branches are touching, and so it's just like a plague run straight through the plantation. Ford tried relocating the project to a town downstream, Belterra, planting another 16,000 acres with rubber trees, but these too all died. Ford's son eventually abandoned the project in 1945. The Fordlandia buildings still stand in Brazil, abandoned, and to this day, there is no cure for the leaf blight. The blight is so fatal to rubber trees, they can't grow in plantations in their native country. That's why South America makes up less than 2% of the rubber supply. Over 90% comes from Asia, which is why it is so essential to prevent the spread of the leaf blight to Southeast Asia. Virtually all of the rubber trees in Southeast Asia came from those seeds Henry Wickham stole, and newer trees are just clones of the old ones. So, the farms are essentially just one big monoculture. As a consequence of that, we are particularly prone to potential outbreaks of funguses and things like that. If you get a fungal infection in Malaysia, then you would end up dramatically reducing global production of rubber. So, what's the outcome if we were cut off from rubber? If SALB gets established in Southeast Asia and you lose natural rubber, then you're talking about a complete global societal meltdown. You're left now with making synthetic rubber tires at the most. Worst case, they can't make them. You can't make a truck tire. You won't have any airplanes. But the real potential is is urban famine. Over 50% of the world's population is in cities. How will you move food into the cities to feed them? But something like this did wipe out a large part of the rubber supply just 6 years ago. In 2019, two different diseases jumped from palm trees to rubber trees in Thailand. In 6 months, these diseases had spread across seven countries and a million acres of trees. And the next year saw a 10% drop in production. And the only reason it didn't destroy more trees was because of a different outbreak that we all remember. COVID comes in early 2020. It stopped the spread of these diseases as as a byproduct of trying to stop the spread of COVID. If COVID hadn't hit there, how far would that have gone? How many more millions of acres would have in effect been killed or seriously compromised by these two leaf blights? Granted, it's hard to predict what would happen if we ran out of natural rubber. Some say the impact could be catastrophic. Grounded planes, failed railways, even famine. And any disruption to the oil supply chain would send shock waves through synthetic rubber products. But oil is such a polarizing and politically charged topic deeply tied to global power struggles and hidden incentives that it's hard to know what's truly at stake. That's why we specifically asked Ground News to sponsor this video. They gather news sources from around the world in one spot so you can read about the same issue from different perspectives with the context needed to separate facts from politics. For example, Iran controls a single strait that handles roughly 20% of the world's oil. What happens when they threaten to close it amid US strikes on their nuclear sites? Well, on the topic, USA Today ran oil hits five-month high after US strikes key Iranian nuclear sites. But the New York Post led with US stock surge after restrained Iran attack on US base. One headline warned to a looming energy crisis, the other stock market rally and strategic restraint. It's the same event, but completely different conclusions. In times of uncertainty, knowing who is telling you the story and why is just as important as knowing what actually happened. Ground News helps you do that by showing you the split headlines and surfacing stories hidden from your usual news feeds due to bias through their blind spot feed. In fact, the Nobel Peace Center called ground news an excellent way to stay informed, avoid echo chambers, and to expand your worldview. And I agree. If we want to properly understand the crisis affecting us here at home and around the world, we need better tools. And I can't recommend ground news as that tool enough.

And now back to rubber. We take natural rubber for granted in a huge number of different products. So if you take a typical car, there's something close to 250 to 300 rubber components within the car. You would have a nightmare trying to re-engineer all of those out of synthetic materials. If we were to lose natural rubber and just rely on synthetic rubber, would it still be possible to do those applications? So, this has happened in the past. If you think about it, all of these synthetic polymers come from that initial thought process that we can't we can't get natural rubber. We have to create other stuff. It's a national security issue. That's wild. You're just like, \"Oh, it's a tire.\" But think about it. If you don't have tires, you can't move a military. Yeah. Yeah, the obvious question is if natural No text rubber is so great, why can't we just replicate it in the lab? And that's the exact thing that the US tried when during the Second World War, Japan cut it off from roughly 97% of the world's natural rubber supply. Modern wars cannot be won without rubber. What then happened was an enormous investment by the US equivalent to 11.1 billion in today's terms uh into synthetic rubber and growing uh alternative natural rubber crops. That's roughly a third of the Manhattan project. It was a complete gamble, but the four big US tire companies were able to improve and manufacture a synthetic rubber called styrene butadene in less than 3 years. Unlike natural rubber, styrene butadiene is made from two monomers, roughly 25% styrene and 75% butadiene. Both usually come from crude oil refining. The monomers are dispersed in water and combined into long chains in a random arrangement. Then the rubber is vulcanized. Now compared to natural rubber, it doesn't wear down as quickly under friction, but it has a much lower tensile strength. In 1942, the US used 99.6% natural rubber and 0.4% synthetic. But in 1945, it was practically reversed at 14% natural and 86% synthetic. Now almost 70% of all rubber consumed is synthetic. And the most common one is still styrene butadine. But there are some things that natural rubber is just better at. If you think about airplane tires, it's absolutely incredible that they're up there at degrees below zero before they start to come into land. And then you've got this huge weight of the airplane on these dinky little tires that increase in temperature enormously over an incredibly small space of time. And only natural rubber can do it. So airplane tires are essentially 100% natural rubber and you can't land if you've got synthetic in the tire. So what can natural rubber do that we just can't replicate? Okay. What I want you to think about is you start to stretch it. This first movement hardly it's very easy to stretch that bit. That first bit very simple. Now think about how much force you're using to continue to stretch it. Yeah. It gets harder. It gets harder and harder and harder and harder. Yeah. And then eventually you'll get to a break point. Yeah. But what's happening, why it's getting harder is that the rubber is getting stronger as you stretch it. As you stretch the polymers, they start to align and stick together through weak intermolecular forces called Van der Waals forces. When they are packed tightly enough, the polymers freeze together in thin sheet-like crystals aligned in the direction you stretch. And as you keep pulling, more and more polymers join the crystal structure. Each crystal acts as a new cross link, making the rubber harder and stronger. That ability to form crystallites prevents tear. Um, so if you have crack propagation, it hits a crystal and can't go any further. In a sample without a crack, the stress is evenly distributed. But if there is a crack, more load flows right to the edge, so the rubber stretches more. That area forms more crystals, so it becomes harder to break. The crystals stop the crack growth until a threshold is reached, and then it breaks. This is what makes natural rubber so durable. It's self-reinforcing under stress, stopping cracks in their tracks. Crystallization is what makes natural rubber so good for tough applications. The plane can weigh 500, 600 tons. So if you think about that, you've got a, you know, each tire is taking 20 tons and it's coming from a very cold temperature up there. Yeah, it's -50 - 60 depending exactly how high you've been flying. And you go from zero rotational speed to quite fast, very fast. You get generate a lot of frictional heat really quickly as well. There's a reason why they make tires for planes out of natural rubber and that's because it's really demanding application and the crystallization helps a huge amount preserve those tires and help them last. One study notes that experiment has shown that no detectable crack propagation occurs in rubber undergoing crystallization until the stress is so high as to generate abrupt catastrophic fracture. Oh, that was fast. And then eventually you'll get to a break point and yeah, you finally overcame it. When you pull on a rubber sample, you're applying a stress. The polymers realign and the wiggle unfolds. So the piece deforms and gets longer. The per unit change in length is known as strain and we can plot this on a stress/strain curve. Lots of materials are elastic around low stresses. You stretch it a little and the spacing between atoms changes. But when you remove the force, it goes back to its original shape. But eventually you hit a stress where there is permanent deformation. That's called the yield point. The material can't go back to the same shape after. And if you keep going, it will fracture. But the stress/strain curve for rubber is a little weird. It starts out stretching very far with very little force. That's the easy part. But then as you keep pulling, the stress shoots up really fast. So stretch stretch it fast. What do you notice? It's a little warm. Maybe it's hot. It's gone up in temperature by 10\u00b0. That section where it gets really hard to pull it any further and it gets hotter, that's right where rubber starts to crystallize. The rubber warms up because as those new bonds form, they release a bit of energy as heat. Then if you keep stretching it, you get to the point where the crystal can no longer hold it and it breaks. But something strange happens if you stop right before that fracture point. Then the rubber bounces back, but on a lower curve. Keep it stretched. Keep it stretched. Wiggle it around. Now relax it. Touch it to your lips. What do you got? Now it's like much cooler. Yeah. Yeah. So you went from crystallization from you stretched it. You crystallized. That's an exothermic reaction. Wow. Okay. You then allowed it to cool down to room temperature in the stretch state and you relaxed it and you dissolved the crystals. That's weird. How do you dissolve the crystals? You've got to take energy from somewhere to dissolve crystals. You cool the rubber band down. The reason the two curves are different is because it takes more energy to align the polymers than it does for the polymers to curl back up. And this energy difference is exactly the heat that's released over a full cycle. We've seen that natural rubber is built using these building blocks, but the technical monomer is actually isoprene, which looks like this. It's the same atoms, but with some groups and bonds moved around. So, the technical term for rubber is cis 1-4 polyisoprene. And we've actually been able to make synthetic cis 1-4 polyisoprene. You can take isoprene and polymerize it. So it should behave exactly like natural rubber. Right? And that one is the closest, but it doesn't perform nearly as well because it's not structurally as perfect as natural rubber. See, there are two ways for the monomers to attach. In natural rubber, they attach on the same side. The cis attachment. the percentage of cis in in in the molecular chain that nature can provide is is really accurately. It's 99.99% something of that sort of scale. But with synthetic rubber, it's easy for monomers to attach on the opposite side of the double bond. That's the trans attachment. But now there's more room for them to lay flat. They don't have that extra wiggle, so they stretch less and don't crystallize very well. And when you make the synthetic equivalent, it's pretty good, but it's 98% uh cis polyisoprene. There is, you know, one or two percent is going to be trans polyisoprene and therefore isn't so susceptible for crystallization and it's not as good and hasn't got the same strength properties that natural rubber would have. In a tensile test, a synthetic rubber also stretched to around 600% before breaking. But it only took around 9.1 megapascals compared to over 14.1 megapascals for natural rubber. But there are a few areas where synthetic rubber is actually better than natural. Under low stress where crystallization doesn't happen, natural rubber loses the advantage. So synthetic is preferred for the tread of passenger car tires for better abrasion resistance. Nitrile rubber, a synthetic rubber used for gloves, also blocks harsher chemicals from passing through. So in poly isoprene we used to see let's say in um chemotherapy agents maybe 80-90% permeation in night trial we see maybe 10-20%. Wow. So it's much better. That's huge. That's huge for a cancer center worker. That's huge. Nitrial gloves were No text developed in the late 1980s during the global AIDS pandemic in response to the growing latex allergy. Surprisingly, gloves weren't required for every single procedure until the CDC published a mandate to prevent HIV transmission in 1987. After the demand for gloves went from 300 million to over 36 billion by the end of the 1980s, well, dozens of new latex glove factories sprang up to meet the demands. Typically, after a mold is dipped in latex, the glove is leached and lots of proteins from the tree are just washed away. But then they got rid of that step. This meant that all of those soluble proteins were left in the glove. So when nurses or doctors were putting on or taking off these unleashed powdered gloves, they would disperse all of those proteins into the air. The nursing staff were breathing those particles in, breathing that dust in through their entire shifts and into their lungs. At the patients, you've got these pro these gloves with loads of proteins washing that away around in your innards. Thousands of people were exposed enough to become allergic to latex. In the early '9s, they said if you have if you've had four surgical procedures, you almost certainly have type 1 latex allergy. If you have if you've had 10, you do. So eventually manufacturers received enough complaints that they started leaching again. But by then it was too late. Even if something's been properly leached, if someone has that type 1 latex allergy, they're still going to react to it. Nitrile gloves help combat that allergy. But for long surgeries, some doctors still prefer the softer and more comfortable glove that comes from natural latex. So, Dr. Cornish has been working on alternative natural rubber from the Guayule plant, which doesn't have the proteins that people are allergic to. This plant can grow in desert climates, and it makes a stronger, softer rubber than even the Brazilian rubber tree. Not only does scaling up Guayule help with the latex allergy, it's also a safeguard in case the blight ever makes its way across to Southeast Asia. Transportation, healthcare, construction, there are so many industries that are dependent on natural rubber. There are regulations around South American leaf blight control and it's difficult to get a direct flight from Brazil to Southeast Asia, but not impossible. It seems short-sighted to leave the industry vulnerable to like one bad flight. For a material that only became useful around 200 years ago, it's now hard to imagine life without it. When Henry Ford developed Ford Landia, he didn't consult a single rubber tree expert who could have told him about the blight. So, let's not make that same mistake again."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: physics of throwing an American football"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "He's the greatest Americanfootball quarterback of all time. Holy.- Can you hear it go by you?- (laughing) Yeah, it's scary. (dynamic music) He's won seven Super Bowls and has thrown the mosttouchdown passes in history. Ooh.- Ooh, that one hurt the chest, I heard that. Right in the chest.- I'm like glad I'm not catching those. Every quarterback takes pride in their ability to throw a tight spiral. The tighter the spiral you throw means the more controlyou have of the football. We analyzed his throw in detail. Have people shot you in really slow motion for the release and everything? Never.- And discovered something surprising. Even Tom Brady can'tthrow a perfect spiral. Just look.- Said hut. On his deep passes, no matter how hard he triesto spin the ball cleanly around its long axis, if you look closely enough, you'll notice this little wobble. Not only that, there's aslight drift to the ball, which means even Tom Brady can't throw straight. Virtually all his longpasses curve to the right. But these aren't mistakes, they're actuallyfundamental to the physics of throwing a football accurately. To find out why, we ran a full computationalfluid dynamics analysis, tested spinning balls in a wind tunnel, and even embedded sensorsin real footballs. That's crazy. Now, admittedly, who are we to tell Tom Brady anything about football? (inquisitive music)(Derek grunting) I've never really played much football. I grew up in Canada. I'd be much happier to be playing hockey. Like why can't I throw at all? That is so rough. Okay, well, he'll walk you through it, I'm not gonna bother doing it (laughing) right now.- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (upbeat music) Try to do this, over-exaggerate the tilt. So instead of standing straight up-- Yeah, lean forward? lean like you're almostlike a shortstop, right, and like you're falling over, and then you're just here, like that.(Derek grunting and laughing) Good catch.- So lean over a little bit.- I feel like I'm like not ready for it.- So get down like a shortstop.- Yeah, yeah, like this?- Even more. Even more?- Yeah. Now throw it sidearm.- Yeah? I feel like this is weird. There you go, that was a better throw. That is a better throw. It was really good. [Derek] What's the key to throwing like a really tight spiral? The key to me is, first of all, you gotta have very light grip pressure on the football. I learned over a period of time that I had to be reallyefficient with my mechanics. I had to have all my energy going right toward the target with a very relaxed posture. And then it's a really smooth,efficient throwing motion. [Derek] And then howare you actually imparting the spin to the ball? So you're really poppingyour wrist at the end. So I can even go really slow and just pop my wrist at the end. And even that little bit of wrist pop will create a little snap on the ball as it releases from my fingertips. Henry, you can't drop the easy one. (bright music) That snap and the spin it creates is the key to Brady'srecord-breaking throw. But the big question is why? I mean, what does the spin actually do to the football?(audience cheering) It seems like such a simple question, but the physics turned outto be much more complicated than I initially thought. In fact, physicists studying the problem didn't get close to the real answer until just five years ago. So let's break it down from the start. A question for Tom is, can he throw the ball without spinning it. Like a knuckleball? Yeah, can you knuckleball a football? Yeah, I could try. Can I throw it underhand? Yeah, yeah, yeah.- Yeah, however you wanna toss it. Even overhand, there's no way to do it without getting a spin on it or it's just gonna mess with you? I mean, you'd have toalmost throw it sideways. Yeah, yeah. Oh, that spun a little bit. When you launch a ball without spin, perfectly aligned withthe direction of motion, it seems like the airflowing over the ball will be totally symmetric. But this is unstable. Any slight disturbance, like a tiny bit of wind, will cause more air to hitone side than the other, and that starts to changethe ball's orientation. And now more area on that side is exposed to the oncoming air, so it deflects even more. So drag on the ball increases, it's pushed off course, and it can begin to tumble. The total drag force on the ball is proportional to the areapresented to the airflow and the drag coefficient. That's just a measure of howstreamlined an object is. Pointed straight in thedirection of motion, a football is pretty streamlined, with a drag coefficient of just 0.14. That's better than a bullet. But on its side, thedrag coefficient is 0.85, which is worse than a cow. Man, I'm learning a lot today. That's what I'm gonna usewith all the quarterbacks, going, \"Man, your drag coefficient sucks.\" (laughing) \"What are we doing? We need .14. .85, no good. To make matters worse, when a football is going sideways, it exposes nearly 70% morearea to the oncoming air. And combined with thehigher drag coefficient, this means that the drag force is 10 times greater than when the football isaligned with the throw. So an un-spinning ballcan end up going sideways, meaning it deceleratesup to 10 times faster. Plus, as it tumbles, the air pushes on it indifferent directions, making it move unpredictably. Now, in some cases,you actually want this. Like when kicking the ballback to the other team, punters sometimes intentionallykick the ball end over end so that it gets pushed around erratically. That makes it far harderfor the opposing team to predict where the ball's gonna go and get under it. But when you're passing to your own team, you want the ball to be predictable and go as fast and as far as possible. And for that, you need spin. (suspenseful music) The benefits of spin really became clear in the mid 1800s during the Crimean War. Back then, soldierswere armed with muskets that fired round lead balls. And to make reloadingfaster on the battlefield, these musket balls weremade significantly smaller than the barrel. But when the gunpowder was ignited, some of the expandinggases would then escape around the bullet, making the bullet's exitvelocity unpredictable. This, combined withinconsistent manufacturing and the round ball's poor aerodynamics, meant that muskets weresomewhat unreliable. There was a Britisharmy musketry instructor who famously said, \"I'm willing to stand andbe shot at all day long, as long as whoever's shooting at me with the smoothbore musket promises to aim at me every single time.\" (Henry laughing)Because he knew the bullet's never actually gonna go (laughing) where the gun is being aimed. (pensive music) [Derek] All of thatchanged in the fall of 1854. Russian troops huddled in Sevastopol under siege by French and British forces. The soldiers watched as British troops set up on a distant hillside. They were far out ofstandard musket range, so the Russians weren't worried, when suddenly a window shatters.(window smashing) They were shooting through the windows of the Russian barracks attheir naval base in Sevastopol, 900 yards away, they're shooting bulletsthrough the windows. (window smashing)- But these were no ordinary bullets. Eight years earlier, an enterprising French armyofficer, Claude-Etienne Minie, made a breakthrough. He developed a conicalbullet with a hollow base and an iron plug that would fit into it. So when fired, the gas pressure drovethe plug into the base, which expanded the bullet, pressing it firmlyagainst the barrel walls so no gas could escape. This made the bullet's muzzle velocity much more predictable. But it also enabled something else. The expanded bulletcould grip spiral grooves carved into the inside of the barrel, called rifling. This imparted spinned thebullet as it shot out. And this is key because all spinning objectshave a fundamental quantity they can serve, angular momentum. This helps them resistchanges in their orientation. It's just like the spinning top. Now, without spin, the top just falls over like you'd expect. But if we add a little bit of spin, we can see that it resistschanges in its orientation. So if I give it a little touch, it reorients itself in the direction of its angular momentum. [Derek] A similar thinghappens with a spinning bullet. Its angular momentum resists changes to its axis of rotation. So even if wind applies anunbalanced force to the bullet, it maintains its orientation. This reduces drag and helpsthe projectile fly further, faster and more accurately. The exact same thing is going on when Tom Brady throws a tight spiral. The important part of a spiral is you feel the wind blown at us. If the ball wobbles at all, it's gonna catch a lot ofresistance in the wind, and it's gonna slow thevelocity of the ball down a lot and the accuracy. The tighter the spiral and the more it spins, the more it can justrotate through the air and the wind will have aless effect on the ball. So for any good quarterback, the ability to throw a tight spiral is really important when you play in windy conditions. A spinning ball willmaintain its orientation, and therefore cut through the air with a smaller frontal area and a lower drag coefficient. This all makes sense, but here's where things get weird. If the ball is maintaining its orientation then on a long Hail Mary pass, it should stay pitched uplike this the whole time, just like when it was thrown. But that is not what happens. There's kind of a paradox in football, which is, when you release the ball, you're angled say positive 30 degrees. Okay. And when your receiver catches it, it's angled negative 30 degrees. Perfect, I love that. So what we just said was, angular momentum makesthe ball hard to pivot. Okay.- But what we saw was it pitches from thisto this in four seconds. Right, turnover- Yes, exactly.- is what we would call that. Now, turnover is essential to a good throw because it means at everypoint along the arc, the ball's orientationstays closely aligned with its direction of motion. That means it stays pointeddirectly into the airflow, which minimizes drag. Now, sure, you might thinkthis isn't that crazy? I mean, arrows and birdies align themselves along thepath of the arc as well. But that works in these cases because the objects are front weighted. The feathers catch the air and get pushed behind the heavier tip, which leads the way. But a football's totally different. I mean, it doesn't have feathers or fins, and its weight is evenlydistributed along its axis. So it just can't use the samemechanisms to align itself. So in 2020, the editor-in-chief of \"The American Journal of Physics\" decided to figure it out. I was surprised at howmany bad explanations that were easy to debunk got published. When you think about it, it doesn't make any sense, because the air resistance would push the nose of the football up, and you want the nose ofthe football to go down. So it's pretty curious. [Henry] So Price puttogether a theoretical model to explain the football's turnover. And today, we're gonna seewhether his findings hold up by simulating Tom Brady's own throws in a wind tunnel. The idea of having anythingto do with Tom Brady, whom I greatly respect, not only because of his skill, but because of his work ethic. It's otherworldly. (dynamic music) We have these sensors in these balls. So we should be able to see how fast the balls are actuallygoing from inside the ball. And just to be sure, I'm measuring the speed of these balls the old-fashioned way, a decision I might regret. Do you wanna go right on the side of the dummy with the gun? I'll throw it right over your head. (Derek laughing) I won't hit you, trust me. (dynamic music) Yeah, right there, perfect. Ready?- Yep. 45. Maybe scoot just a smidge more that way. Perfect. Holy (bleep). 46. You gonna do another one? Yeah. (dynamic music) (football whizzing) 49. My God, that's scary. That's like 80 kilometers an hour. But would you actuallyuse that speed in a game? That'd be a good speed. That's a normal pass. That's like terrifying. (upbeat music) And that's just for a regular throw. For his long throws, the speed jumps even higher, over 60 miles per hour, that's almost 100 kilometers per hour. Now, I'm not about to stepin front of that cannon. I was not built for being an athlete. You're built foranalyzing the. (laughing) That's right, I'm here for the data. And that's why I've got Henry here. Ooh. Ooh, that one hurt the chest. I heard that. Sure you don't wannaswap in, Derek? (laughing) You're doing great. (dynamic music) When Tom Brady is throwing, you gotta react fast. But that kind of pressure isn't limited to the football field. Now, the internet's a lot like football. When you're online, threats are coming at you from all sides. Now, you got hackers, you got trackers, you got ads for thingsyou never even googled. And you don't evenhave to be near someone to mess with them. (laughing) That was close. (laughing) (transition beeping) With today's sponsor, NordVPN, it's like having your own offensive line. (upbeat music) (Henry sharply exhaling)- NordVPN gives you real protection. It hides your IP, masks your location, and encrypts all your internet traffic so no one sees what you're doing online.

I'd like to thank NordVPNfor sponsoring this video. And now, back to Tom Brady. Have people shot you in really slow motion for the release and everything? Did you ever watch that back? Never. [Derek] You guys ready? I'm ready. [Ricky] Three, two, one. Oh my God. Are you good? You good, Ricky? [Ricky] Yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good. [Henry] Is that plexyor is that real glass? That's plexiglass.- That's incredible. You get one shot at these things. Oh (bleep), all right, I'd have given it my best. Should we try one more,even if the camera breaks? (Henry and Derek laughing) [Ricky] I don't see the cracks- Wow.- so we can go again. Let's try one more.- Are you kidding? Let me just throw a little harder. All right, let's go again. I'm gonna throw a little harder. (football smacking) [Ricky] Aw. Now we're broke down.- That went right there. Are we able to watch the throw back? Good spiral. (laughing) Oh, that's so cool. The sensors show Brady'smaximum spin rate on this day was 628 revolutions per minute. So armed with this data, let's analyze Brady'sthrows in a wind tunnel. How much data are you used to getting? Zero.- Really? When I played? Yeah.- None of it was available. (dynamic music) [Phillip] So this isthe low-speed wind tunnel here at the university. This wind tunnel facilitycan get up to about Mach .2, so 20% of the speed of sound. [Derek] Typically this wind tunnel is used in the developmentof advanced wing geometries for innovative sustainableaircraft design. But today, it's being used for football. We have just a sting mount mounted to a turntable. We actually have asix-component load cell here. And with this six-component load cell, we can measure all threecomponents of force and torque. We then have an electric motor, right, that we can spin to basicallysimulate the spiral. [Derek] First, we're gonnasimulate one of Brady's throws where the ball travelsstraight into the airflow with his classic spiral. (inquisitive music) And everything proceeds as we expect, no significant forces or torques develop. But during a game, a ball doesn't travel like this in a straight line. During any throw, its center of mass follows aroughly parabolic trajectory. So let's say you align the ball perfectly with thisparabola when you launch it. Well, then, from the ball's perspective, just a moment later, thisparabola starts to curve down away from the ball, which means more air will be hitting the undersideof the ball than on top. Now, you would expect thiswould tilt the ball back, but that's only what happens if the ball is not spinning. If it is spinning, then the situation is very different, which you can see with this amazing demo. Imagine this ring of golf balls is like a cross-sectionalslice of the football. Here's what happens whenI try and push it back with this leaf blower. (leaf blower blowing) I mean, it tilts backjust like you'd expect. But if I do the exact same thing, but this time, get the wheel spinning, tilts out to the right. And you can see why if we slow it down. So as the ring passes the leaf bar, that's where the force is applied. But each ball still has momentum in the direction of rotation. So it actually reaches its peak 90 degrees further along from where the force is applied, and this is known asgyroscopic procession. So if the wind was hitting it, it's gonna keep the point up. So you'd think that itwould just push it back. Right?- But because it's spinning, when you push up, it actually tilts to the right. Oh, interesting. But it doesn't stop there. As the ball tilts right, it exposes more area on that side. So now, because of gyroscopic procession, the ball pitches downward. And with more air hittingthe top of the ball, well, it's going to deflect to the left. And that is going to makethe ball deflect back up. And now we're back to where we started. So this cycle is going to repeat, but since this is happening continuously, the nose traces out a circle around the direction of airflow. So we get a slow wobble. We used to joke, wheneveryou would not throw a tight spiral, you would call it a tight wobbler. That was a Brett Favre-coined phrase. He let it go and havea little wobble to it, and he'd go, \"Oh, tight wobbler.\" (Henry laughing) Now, if the ball werejust traveling straight, this would be the whole story. But remember from before, the ball's path is a parabola, meaning that from the ball's perspective, the oncoming air is constantlydipping down away from it. So the ball is trying to process around the airflow direction, but that direction is constantly changing. (light music) For example, by the timethe ball has reached the bottom of the procession, the airflow has moved down too. And what that means is the ball is not gonna tilt out to the left as much as you'd expect. So when it processes back up, it doesn't go as high as where it started. And over time, it is thisthat gradually pitches the nose of the football down, keeping it aligned withits parabolic path. I can visualize it all, your fancy science words. Okay, okay.- I'm going all the way back to my high school days. I was a very average science student, so. But you're teaching me a lot. As the ball goes through the air, there's gonna be more air resistance on the bottom of the ball than on the top. The front of the ball, not the back, 'cause that's hitting the wind first. The front bottom of the ball. Okay. And so what that means is, it creates this processiveeffect that pushes it out, pushes it down, pushes it right. It creates a wobble no matter what you do. Very cool.- So wobble is actually not only impossible to avoid, but it's essential to make sure that the ball follows the path that you want it to follow. [Derek] You can seethis in the wind tunnel. We've tilted the ball up by three degrees and it's free to pivot in any direction. Yeah, you're definitely seeing a pitch. Oh, that's awesome. What we're seeing is, it's starting out aligning itself about three degrees off. You know, 'cause that's how we spin it up. But as the airflow starts, it's pointing itself in thedirection that minimizes drag. That's so cool. I mean, that's exactlywhat we were expecting, but it's still incredibleto see it in person. (inquisitive music) [Derek] If you look ata real football flight, you'll notice that it spends more time angled slightly to the right when thrown by a right hander. That is what creates the force, which, through procession, gradually pitches the nose downward. It creates the turnover effect that Tom Brady was talking about. Just wanna reframe the wobble as not necessarily a bad thing. Okay, good.- (laughing) Yeah. Peyton Manning had agood wobble on the balls, but he found a way to completea lot of touchdowns that way. (inquisitive music) [Derek] But theright-ward lean of the ball also has an unintended side effect. Something we've heard is that for right-handed throwers, the ball will drift right, and for left-handed throwers, the ball will drift left. Do you think that's true or is that something you notice? So I wouldn't necessarilyagree with that. So we got Tom to throw straight down one ofthe lines on the field. Is the drone set? That's a pretty straight throw. [Tom] Henry, don't move,you're making it look bad. (Derek laughing) I'll stay planted. The more still you go, the better it looks for my throw. It's like a catcher. when you frame the pitch. [Henry] I'll frame it,I'll frame it. (laughing) (bright music) From ground level, his passes looked amazingly straight. But from the drone, if you watch closely, just at the end of the pass, the ball does drift off to the right. This is because up until now, we've been ignoring a veryimportant aerodynamic effect, which is lift. When the ball is tilted to the right, it generates lift out in that direction. The more it's tilted, the larger this force is. The rightward tilt is required to get the ball to turn over during its parabolic path. But it does mean that right-handed throws tend to drift, right? The effect is subtle, but some players notice it intuitively. In the fall of 1991, Jerry Rice, generally considered thegreatest wide receiver of all time, changed quarterbacks. In place of the right-handed Joe Montana, he was now catching passes from the left-handed Steve Young. And for Rice, something felt off. He wasn't sure exactly why, but he said the throwswere coming up short. Of course, what was actually happening was that the ball was drifting away from where he expected it to be. Joe Montana's right-handed throws drifted to the right, whereas Steve Young's drifted left. It's a subtle effect, but it's all part of the procession that minimizes drag on the ball and lets it fly farther, faster and more accurately. So it's not becauseyou're a bad quarterback throwing it with a wobble, it's because wind, you know? Okay, so what if you're ina dome and there's no wind? See, that's a great question. So I'm just saying thisis just air resistance. So even in a dome, thesame thing would happen. Whether in an outdoorstadium or a closed-top dome, the ball will always wobble. But outdoor stadiums aresignificantly harder to throw in because of the wind. With the ball being thrownat 50 to 60 miles per hour, most of the airflow over the ball is due to its own motion, but in winds gustingover 15 miles per hour, the weather starts to play a major role. We commissioned the NFL data team to do an analysis of completion percentage in outdoor stadiums versus indoor domes. And they found thatthrows in indoor stadiums are consistently more accurate, no matter the distance. So maybe Brady was harddone by Foxborough, New England's stadium. Do you prefer to throw ina game when it's no wind? Do you prefer wind, rain, snow? Does it matter? I preferred outdoor, 70 degrees, humid, tiny little breeze, just to keep you cool. Right, but why didyou like being outdoors as opposed to being in a dome? I felt like my depth perception was a little better outside. I liked just the naturalfeel of the natural air. The dome always felt like a vacuum. Do you think you had an edge if the weather was bad compared to other quarterbacks? I would say yes. And the reason why isI'd say I practiced in it all the time. And I think getting used to the conditions and the familiarity of the wind, of the humidity, of the rain, of the snow, you know,grass field, turf field, I knew exactly what to wearfor every single condition. I played 23 seasons, 100to 120 practices a year. You saw everything.- So that's over 2,000 plus practices. That's crazy.- You know the thickness you want your sleeves, you go, okay, \"What's the temperature? It's 50 degrees. Okay, this is the shirt Iwear when it's 50 degrees. Oh, it's 35 degrees, this is the two shirts I wear when it's 35 degrees. You know, this is the muff that I wear. You know, this is how manyheat packs I put in the muff to keep my hand warm when it's 30 degrees versus 50 degrees.\" You had it all dialed in. You just have to, I mean,you just observe over time, and you, you know, get better and better. It's a lot like an F1 car. You know, everything is just fractions of, you know, things to do to make yourself feelthe most comfortable. So maybe Brady is a bit more scientific than he gives himself credit for. Over 383 career games, more than 7,700 completed passes and tens of thousandsof hours on the field, Brady intuitivelyunderstands all the physics we've just analyzed. Plus he knows how to harness these effects to get the ball where he wants it to go with just a few seconds to throw it. In a game where perfection is impossible, he's internalized all the complex physics, the kinematics, the aerodynamics, and he still makes it look simple. Yeah, I don't have to move. (laughing) So we actually made a videotogether with Tom Brady teaching us how to throw a football. And if you wanna learn more about that, you can check it out right here. (dynamic music) Now what we got for you are some balls that you'venever thrown before. Oh God, what haveyou guys got cooked up? But we're not done yet. What the heck? In other sports, surfaces are engineered down to the smallestdetail to control airflow. But footballs, they'vehardly changed in decades. So we tested whether a football'sdesign is really optimal. And to find out, we had Tom Brady througha series of custom balls, including one built toeliminate his spin entirely. I don't even know howyou could throw that. Now, in investigating this, we actually uncovered a secret technique that teams are using to modify their balls and give their players an advantage. But we'll get to that in a future video. So make sure to subscribeand stay notified, and we'll see you then. That's insane.(Henry laughing) (transition whirring) (transition whooshing)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: Alfred Nobel"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most people don't know the real story of Alfred Nobel. (dramatic music) One morning in 1888, Alfred Nobel sat down to read the newspaper in his conservatory. He scanned the pages casually, but then, he froze. The Merchant of Death is dead. Dr. Alfred Nobel, who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before, died yesterday. It was his own obituary. The newspaper had made a mistake. Alfred's older brother Ludwig had died in France, and the journalists had confused the two. (dramatic music) But in that moment, he saw exactly how the world would remember him, not as an inventor, but as a butcher. Now, the wording in the obituary, the Merchant of Death and all that, well, it's likely been exaggerated over the years. We could only find an obituary that described him as a man who can hardly be passed off as a benefactor of humanity. But reading this allowed Alfred to see what others truly thought of him, and it wasn't good. He had earned his reputation building an empire on one substance. Nitroglycerin. It's one of the most powerful explosives in the world. Its blast pressure is over 100 times greater than gunpowder. (explosion booms) - Oh my God. Woo! Oh, that's so sick. But that power comes at a price. Nitroglycerin is so sensitive that if it's dropped, shaken, or even just bumped, it can detonate. And as a result, hundreds of workers died trying to handle it. So Alfred made it his mission to tame this beast. But in doing so, he created powerful new explosives used in everything from blasting tunnels to making bombs, tools that transformed the modern world, but also contributed to deaths of tens of thousands of people, unleashing a level of destruction that would come to define him. (ground rumbles) Alfred's father, Immanuel was also an inventor. He opened the first ever rubber factory in Sweden and invented the rotary lathe, which made modern plywood possible. But Immanuel struggled with business. He went bankrupt shortly after Alfred was born. So Immanuel set off to Russia to start over, leaving his family behind. Some of Alfred's earliest memories were of watching his brothers sell matches on the street corners of Stockholm just to afford food. He was often sick, bedridden with colds, stomach problems, and bouts of depression. He would later say, \"Mine was a pitiful half-life, which ought to have been extinguished by some compassionate doctor as I yelled my way into the world.\" But soon after Alfred turned nine, a letter arrived from his father asking the family to join him in St. Petersburg. In the early 1850s, the great powers of Europe were gearing up for war. And Immanuel spotted an opportunity. He realized Russia's capital was vulnerable to attack from the sea. So he approached Tsar Nicholas I with plans for a new kind of explosive device, one that would float in the harbor and detonate on contact with enemy ships. A sea mine. (explosion booms) Within months of his proposal in the Black Sea just off Sinope, the Russian Navy sank an ottoman fleet, and the Crimean war began. Immanuel's invention was suddenly in high demand, and the newly established Nobel armaments factory quickly grew from a few dozen employees to over 1,000, producing mines, torpedoes and other explosives for the Russian military. With money now pouring in, Immanuel decided to invest in Alfred's education. At the age of 17, Alfred found himself in a lab in Paris studying under the world's greatest chemists. And it's here that he met an Italian doctor named Ascanio Sobrero who had a peculiar demonstration. Sobrero would take an ordinary looking piece of cotton and lay it on an anvil. He would raise his hammer and. (mysterious music) - Whoa. (laughs) It's like a bird ran into a window. No text - That was a good one, right? - Yeah, that was a great one. - Soaked into that cotton was a new explosive material, nitroglycerin, and it was unlike anything the world had ever seen before. See, until then, the most commonly used explosive was gunpowder. But it had a major drawback. It's fast, but it's not that fast. When we were doing it, it was much slower than the speed of sound. - Ah! - Jesus! - That's because all the ingredients you need, the carbon for fuel, the potassium nitrate for oxygen and the sulfur to speed up the reaction, they are all in separate grains. And if they're spread far apart, their reaction is just too slow. Come on, you can do it. Go. But if you contain gunpowder, that forces these reactants closer together. And it also traps in heat, which accelerates the reaction. And this allows the pressure from the hot gases to build up until. (explosion booms) (playful music) - You see the explosion and then the powder burst out. - No way. - And then it catches flames. - Yeah. - You can see the whole bottom comes out, and then it just catches up to it. All these particles have to be in close proximity, and they also have to be small enough, and they have to be mixed well enough to get this reaction. So it kinda feels a little bit clunky. Like it's not the ideal way you'd wanna do this, where it's like all the molecules are actually like right next to each other. - That's a great instinct. Putting all the molecules beside each other so that you'd have them all available to react as quickly as possible. But I think I can one up that. And that is, can you put everything you need in the same molecule? - Okay. - And that's what nitroglycerin does. - No way. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay, right? Pretty cool. - That is way cooler. And because of that, it's way more powerful. We've loaded 15 grams of gunpowder and 15 grams of nitroglycerin into test tubes, and then set them in clay blocks so we can compare their destructive power. - This is a bikini gauge for measuring blast over pressure. And it's called the bikini gauge in reference to the bikini atoll because a analog blast over pressure measurement device was used in the nuclear tests in the bikini atoll. It has a number of different diameter holes and a film inside. - [Narrator] The larger circles have more area, and so under the same pressure, they will experience more force and so burst first. The smaller circles take more pressure to break because they've got smaller area. - The smaller the circle that gets punctured means the higher the blast over pressure. - Okay, black powder into clay. - Fire in the hole! Three, two, one. (explosion booms) Yeah, it launched the block a bit. Popped the top right off. - Let's look at the bikini gauge, which looks totally intact. - Looks totally intact. - Yeah. I mean, I'm getting nothing, yeah. - All right. - So, we'll see if we'll leave that for the nitro. When the nitroglycerin goes off, it's gonna be like someone shooting a 50 cal. So I don't know if you've been to the range, but that's gonna be a big blast. (mysterious music) Fire in the hole! Five, four, three, two, one. - Oh. Oh my God. (explosion booms) So first thing I noticed is there are bits of clay that have just rained down on me. I got bits of blue all over me. That's crazy, right there. Is there anything left? - Yeah, there is a bunch of clay on this window, on that window, on this window, on bikini gauge. - It's like a Jackson Pollock painting. (mysterious music) There's no way we've got a frame there. There's just instant white. Joosh When it's fast on the phantom, then it's fast. - (laughs) Right. - Nitroglycerin is incredibly powerful and it gets this power from its molecular structure. See, nitroglycerin is a highly unstable molecule. It consists of a chain of three carbon atoms with three oxygens, and then three nitro groups attached to those, which are just nitrogen atoms bonded to two oxygen atoms. These nitro groups are what makes nitroglycerin so unstable. Oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen. So these two oxygen atoms pull on the electrons from the nitrogen, which shifts the electron density away from this third oxygen. But now there's little shared electron density between these two atoms, which results in a much weaker bond between the nitro groups and the main chain. So you get these weak spots, and all it takes is a little bit of energy, like from the shock created by hammer strike and then those bonds snap apart. So now you've got all these atoms that are swapping partners, and they form much more stable products like nitrogen gas, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. And this process releases a huge amount of energy and heat, and it shoots off the products at high velocities. So then these go on to hit other nitroglycerin molecules, which causes their bonds to break. And if this happens for enough molecules at once, well, it sets off a chain reaction. - Now you've got a shockwave, and now it's going to propagate. And as it propagates through, it's gonna break bonds here, here, here, here, here. - [Henry] Its blast pressure is over 100 times greater than the peak pressures that are produced by gunpowder. - Lots of things will explode even, you know, you pop a balloon and that's an explosion. But the specific kind of explosion we're interested in with nitroglycerin is a detonation. And the detonation is that chemical decomposition that happens faster than the speed of sound in the material. - What we see in our experiments with nitroglycerin is all these things happen really fast. Like less than 100 femtoseconds fast. - I don't operate in femtosecond seconds very frequently. How fast is that? - Well, femtosecond 10 to negative 15 seconds. - That's crazy. So a molecule of nitroglycerin will decompose 3 trillion times faster than the blink of an eye. And it's this speed that is one of the defining characteristics of high explosives. - Yet, Sobrero never set out to discover an explosive. He was searching for a medicine to improve blood flow. During one test, he mixed glycerol with nitric and sulfuric acid, when suddenly, it exploded. (explosion booms) Sobrero survived but shards of glass left permanent scars on his face. Deeply shaken, he concluded this new substance, nitroglycerin, was just too dangerous. He later wrote, \"I am almost ashamed to admit No text to be its discoverer.\" But Alfred disagreed. To him, the hammer strike was like a pistol shot. It was like somebody had kicked open the door to his mind. - It's a real shift in his character. 'cause he is been this frail, sickly boy, kind of has trouble with people. And then he discovers explosives and chemistry and it changes. You know, it's like whenever he is working, he finally isn't depressed. You know, he can kind of escape through his work. - And you know, at that age, you're probably not thinking about all the possible consequences of this. You're just sort of excited about what it can do. Far from fearing its power, he believed he'd be the one to unlock it and solve one of nitroglycerin's greatest problems. - If I had a jar sitting right here and I wanted to detonate it, how do I do that? - Need a long fuse. - But what's crazy about nitroglycerin is that a regular flame won't cause it to ignite. So even if I ran a fuse into that vial, it's not gonna explode. See, while a fuse can heat nitroglycerin, which makes its molecules vibrate faster, and it might even break a few no bonds, it usually doesn't break enough of them at the same time to detonate the rest of the liquid. So it doesn't explode. However, if you drop it. (explosion booms) But even that effect isn't consistent. We tried putting a vial loose in the back of this RC truck, expecting the bumpy ride to trigger it. (playful music) And nothing. - Whoa! - Ah! - It always seems to be blowing up when you don't want it to, and you can't really get it to blow up when you want it to. - That's very paradoxical. (explosion booms) - (laughs) You know, my browser used to look like a blast site too. I had windows and tabs scattered like debris. I had YouTube, Wikipedia, random research articles. Some things that I swear I never opened. But that changed when I switched to today's video sponsor, Opera. With its free built-in AI tool, Aria, I can use the quick shortcut to write a prompt, and then the chaos is gone. I can say close all my YouTube tabs and it's done. Or I can say, group my chemistry papers and it creates this tab island. I can even hover one tab over another tab. Boom, another island. Can expand and collapse them as needed to save space and stay organized. I also love that I can ask Aria anything while researching like, what year did Alfred Nobel patent dynamite in England? And I get the answer instantly without having to switch tabs. It's really helpful when Derek is patiently waiting for the next version of my script. (laughs) If I'm going through an article and wanna take notes, I can just drag one tab down, split the screen, and now I can do both. No need for multiple browser windows. And if I feel like listening to some music in the background, Opera's got a floating music player built into the sidebar. It makes controlling my music easy. I can access my favorite streaming service from anywhere, even while leaving the browser. So if you want a browser that helps you get stuff done, try opera for free by clicking the link in our description, thanks to opera for sponsoring this video. And now, back to some explosions. (mimics explosion) - In 1852, when Alfred returned to Russia, he moved into a cramped apartment with his brother Robert, and he turned their kitchen into a makeshift lab. He was searching for a reliable way to detonate nitroglycerin, dreaming it could one day power his father's sea mines. But when the Crimean war ended in 1856, the Russian government refused to honor the contracts they'd signed during the war. So the Nobel factory was forced to shut down, and Immanuel went bankrupt for the second time. Alfred later wrote that his father was, quote, \"A man of genius, but a failure all the same.\" And so Alfred goes back to Sweden and he decides, he's like, \"I'm not gonna make the mistakes of my father.\" Where does his mind go? Sticking with nitroglycerin. He's like, \"If I can make this, you know, I'll be successful on my own terms.\" No text By the summer of 1862, a 28-year-old Alfred thought he was onto something. Excited, he gathered his brothers by the banks of Lake Malaren just behind his workshop in Stockholm, and he pulled out a metal tube with a fuse extending from the top. He ignited it and tossed it into the water. (explosion booms) (Henry laughs) That's crazy. He had finally found a way to reliably detonate nitroglycerin, and its finished form, it works something like this. Alfred took a container of nitroglycerin and inserted a wooden plug and packed it with gunpowder. Then when the fuse was lit, the gunpowder inside would explode, blasting down into the container. And it was that sudden impact that delivered the shock needed to detonate the nitroglycerin. It was just like the hammer striking the anvil. We need a blasting cap for this. All right, so now Jesse's gonna add a blasting cap. Alfred Nobel's first major adventure. (excited music) I could just like, my heart is just racing more than usual. And I know that it's safe, but yeah, I actually didn't really expect to feel this nervous about it. - Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole! Five, four, three, two, one. (explosion booms) - Oh my god. (explosion booms) Jeez. (laughs) - [Jesse] Stay down. - Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Gotta say that, okay, gotta clear the wrench. - All clear! - Oh my God. - [Jesse] All right, Henry. Yeah, how do you like that? - Geez, man. (explosion booms) (mysterious music) - [Jesse] Is that what you came for? - Yeah, yeah, for sure. That was insane. - Look at how it carved out the exact imprint of the bottle a foot and a half below. Okay, look, we even have puncture on the second to last hole. The smallest is not punctured. - [Henry] Yeah. Wow. - So I mean, that's the entire range of our measurement capability. - Yeah. (laughs) I'm gonna get you through through. (laughs) That's awesome. (laughs) His invention, the blasting cap, was refined to use an even more consistent explosive than gunpowder, mercury fulminate. It became the first reliable way to detonate nitroglycerin on command. The design was so effective, it remained virtually unchanged for decades. I think it'd be hard to argue that this advancement doesn't find its place into every other explosive device that comes after it basically. - Probably the most significant development since the invention of gunpowder. The same idea, using a small explosion to trigger a much larger one would later be used in atomic bombs to set off nuclear chain reactions. With the invention of the blasting cap, the use of nitroglycerin finally became practical. - It can break rock and make tunnels much more effectively. - Nitroglycerin sped up industrial excavation. In one mind, the rate of tunneling almost doubled from 0.76 to 1.34 meters per day. And in Mexico, crews reported that 15 men using nitroglycerin could do the work of 25 with gunpowder. So orders started pouring in from mining companies, engineers, and railway builders from around the world. To meet the sudden demand, Alfred began producing nitroglycerin in Sweden, enlisting the help of his younger brother, Emil. But on the 3rd of September, 1864, an intern asked Emil for help moving a heavy crate. The two began to lift when suddenly, (explosion booms) the factory was ripped apart. (dramatic music) A witness wrote this of the explosion. \"Most ghastly was the sight of the mutilated corpses strewn on the ground. Not only had their clothes been torn off, but on some, the head was missing and the flesh ripped off the bones. These formless masses of flesh and bone bore little or no resemblance to a human body.\" Emil, just 21 years old and four others, the intern, a janitor, a young laborer, and a passing carpenter all died in the explosion. Alfred blamed himself and he swore, \"I will never let this happen again. No text I will make nitroglycerin safe.\" (dramatic music) The city of Stockholm declared nitroglycerin too dangerous and banned its production within city limits. Alfred, however, refused to give up. So this is a moment where he's actually a pretty savvy entrepreneur. He says, \"Okay, if I'm not gonna do it on land, I'm gonna do it on the water.\" So he set up a laboratory on a floating barge on Lake Malaren. But as he was experimenting, another one of his factories in Germany exploded. Alfred was fighting a ticking clock. With every day that passed, more lives were lost. Workers were terrified. No sane agent would use it. A mining publication reported we confidently expect within 30 days to announce another serious accident. See, he had addressed the problem of detonation, but not nitroglycerin's fundamental sensitivity. Because nitroglycerin is so viscous, tiny bubbles of air and water vapor easily get trapped inside. As we zoom in, you'll notice there are even more. These gases are a problem. When a shockwave reaches a bubble, it squeezes it, compressing the gas and heating it up. And it happens so fast that the heat can escape. And so the temperature inside can increase by thousands of degrees Celsius in an instant. It creates a hotspot. The gas molecules in these hotspots carry so much energy that they break the weak N-O bonds in the nitroglycerin molecules nearby. And so these molecules then decompose, releasing even more hot gases. But nitroglycerin doesn't just have one of these bubbles. No, it's filled with them. So that's what makes it so sensitive to shock. A single impact can collapse many bubbles at once, which releases enough energy to trigger the chain reaction that detonates the entire liquid. (explosion booms) Now, you might think to make nitroglycerin safe, Alfred just has to get rid of those bubbles, right? Well, it's not that easy. - You have an air bubble trap, it's like really hard to get that out without like starting to, you know, bang on it. And then you don't wanna do that because you don't want it to go off. - But even if you could remove every single bubble, you would still have a problem. That's because nitroglycerin is a lot like the liquid in this beer bottle. I replaced it with water. And you can see, you know, there aren't many bubbles. But if I give it a smack. (bottle shatters) Whoa! (laughs) The impact drives the bottom of the beer bottle down faster than the liquid can follow, which creates this sudden pressure drop. And that drop of vaporizes the liquid and creates bubbles. When the liquid rushes back in, those bubbles then collapse violently. And those implosions sometimes release enough energy to crack the glass. Now, a similar thing can happen in nitroglycerin. A strong impact can create new bubbles inside the liquid in a process called cavitation. And their collapse again triggers the same chain reaction. (excited music) So Alfred realized that the only way around the bubble problem was to change the state of nitroglycerin from a liquid to a solid. Working on his barge in Germany, he tried mixing in powdered charcoal, sand, wood shavings, brick dust and cement, but nothing really worked. (sullen music) No text Dejected, he looked down and noticed something strange, a fine powder whispering around his feet. So he looked up and saw the same pale threads drifting over the banks of the Elbe. Millions of years earlier, that dust had actually been living organisms, diatoms. Single-celled algae that once floated in ancient seas. But now, in the dunes above the river, all that remained were their fossilized exoskeletons. That made for a fine silica powder that carried on the wind. This material, diatomaceous earth or kieselguhr, had been appreciated by Darwin. He wrote, \"Few objects are more beautiful than the minute siliceous cases of the diatomaceae.\" But Alfred saw beyond their beauty to the microscopic holes in their exoskeletons. - [Jesse] On the granular level, it's got lots of little pores and places to absorb the liquid into. - We're looking for what kind of consistency. - Oh, it's gonna be like a thick and solid. It will make the nitroglycerin less sensitive. So the same hammer impact that you would try with straight nitroglycerin would take more force, because that absorbent material will take some of that energy from the impact. - That kind of feels like we're baking. - Right. - [Henry] In fact, kiesleguhr can soak up more than three times its weight in liquid nitroglycerin. - And so if it's porous now, if you mix it with a nitroglycerin, the nitroglycerin can kind of go into the pores. What that helps do is separate the nitroglycerin molecules from each other. - And within any individual pore, there just isn't enough nitroglycerin to propagate the detonation. So now when it's bumped or shaken, the mixture won't detonate. And if we drop it in the exact same way that set off the nitroglycerin. Drop. It didn't go. - No. - So this new material won't explode when you drop it. So can you still detonate it? Well, if you combine it with Alfred's other invention, the blasting cap, the resulting shockwave is powerful enough to compress many pockets of nitroglycerin at the same time, which triggers the detonation. (explosion booms) (bright music) - [Jesse] The biggest explosion we've seen up to now is 100 grams of nitroglycerin. - [Henry] Yeah, it'll be the biggest one we've done so far. - [Jesse] Three, two, one. (explosion booms) (Henry laughs) - [Henry] Oh, that's so sick. - \"To all whom it may concern, be it known that I, Alfred Nobel have invented a new and useful composition of matter, to wit, an explosive powder.\" (dramatic music) To name it, he took the Greek word dynamis meaning power, and he made it dynamite. (explosion booms) Alfred was determined to capitalize on his new invention, and he believed that he could make the most money in England. England is a jewel worth the rest of the world, he said. A dynamite company there would have the entire empire as its market. So in the spring of 1868, he set foot on British soil carrying with him a suitcase overflowing with dynamite. - 'Cause he is going around and he's inviting journalists to come to these demonstrations where he would bring sticks of dynamite in his backpack and a stand. He would set up these huge boulders, basically, and put a stick of dynamite in there and watch as they like cleft in two. Alfred was a clever salesman. So when Alfred created dynamite, nitroglycerin still had a terrible reputation. And so his initial thought was to name it, \"Nobel's safety powder.\" - Oh. I like that. - Come on down, get you a Nobel Safety powder. Blow the hell out of this rock. You know? Whatever the name. His invention came at the perfect time. Around when Alfred introduced dynamite, there were two other major breakthroughs, the pneumatic drill and the diamond drilling crown, which now made it easy to bore holes in solid rock. Perfect for a stick of dynamite. (explosion booms) These tools revolutionized construction. Many of the iconic engineering feats of the era from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Panama Canal depended on dynamite. One thing that I think is really interesting to think about is Russia at the time isn't the Russia that we think of now. It was effectively a mid-sized European country. 'Cause they had this vast wealth of resources, but it was cut off by these mountains. And so without dynamite, you actually wouldn't have the Russia we have today No text 'cause you would've never been able to make the Trans Siberian Railroad. It's worth saying that dynamite is different than TNT. - Yeah, I was gonna ask about that actually. Trinitroglycerin. - Trinitrotolu, toluene. Tolu? - Trinitrotoluene. - Yup. Trinitrotoluene. - Those nitrogens are bound to carbons, not to oxygens, and so that makes it much more stable so you don't have that really weak oxygen nitrogen bond. Because of that, it is much, much, much less sensitive than nitroglycerin. - So that actually wouldn't be discovered for another couple decades after dynamite, - The TNT labels on the dynamite sticks in the Looney Tunes cartoons never bothered me when I watched them as a kid. But now I'm just like, \"Wait, that's not right. They're not TNT in there.\" - But the main point is that dynamite happened first. And no matter what ACDC says, it is not TNT. - It's a good line. - Yeah, I mean, it's a good track too. So dynamite was changing the world, No text but the old dangers of nitroglycerin were hard to escape. (sullen music) In 1869, near Brentford, England, a barge carrying dynamite exploded on the river Thames, killing three people and damaging buildings 800 meters away. Investigators traced the cause to dynamite that had been sweating beads of nitroglycerin. See, wet kieselguhr from the riverbed has to first be dried to remove moisture. And that leaves empty pores ready to absorb nitroglycerin. But the kieselguhr never loses that strong attraction to water. So if your dynamite is later exposed to moisture, even just humidity in the air, but water seeps back into those pores, and the invading water molecules then encounter nitroglycerin, which gets pushed outwards. Now, moisture wasn't the only culprit. Time and temperature could also cause this separation. But moisture just made the problem a lot worse, though it actually wasn't Alfred's only concern. See, kieselguhr is inert, and since dynamite was about 25% kieselguhr, that meant it would always absorb a large fraction of the explosive energy, and that power was wasted. It reduced the strength of Alfred's explosive, and ultimately, it hurt his bottom line. So he kept experimenting with new formulations and new absorbents. Again and again, he failed. But he was undeterred saying, \"If I have 1,000 ideas and only one turns out to be good, I am satisfied.\" Then one day, while working in his home lab in Paris, he cut his hand. It was a pretty deep cut, and blood started to pour out. So he grabbed a bandage, pressed it to the wound, and watched it soak up the mess. That night, the pain woke him. But as he was lying there in the dark, annoyed at his earlier carelessness, his mind drifted back to the bandage, how clean it was, how fast it absorbed the blood. He bolted upright and rushed down to the lab. He thought, \"If cotton is so good at absorbing blood, maybe it'll be just as good at absorbing nitroglycerin.\" So inside that bandage is this, and it looks like regular cotton, but you'll see it's not when I light it up. Woo! - Yeah, I remember, yeah, watching this YouTube video where they just light it on fire and the whole thing's just gone. And it is so counterintuitive and so just crazy to see. It's like magic. I'm sure it's used in like magic shows too. - Woo! It's called gun cotton or nitrocellulose. And nitrocellulose is made by taking cellulose polymers, say from cotton or wood pulp. And then replacing the oh, groups with oxygen atoms bonded to nitro groups, which are the same unstable groups that made nitroglycerin so explosive. So now when you ignite it, these groups rapidly break down into products like nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water. All of which are gases, so there's no particulate to scatter light. That's why the whole thing seems to just disappear into thin air. But what Alfred was interested in was what happened when you combined it with nitroglycerin? See, nitrocellulose has these chains that are very similar to nitroglycerin chemically because of the nitro groups. So because of that, they mix easily. - Now you have two things that are soluble. They like each other. This is very different from, you know, kieselguhr, water and nitroglycerin. - And now when you mix them, the smaller nitroglycerin molecules slip between these long nitrocellulose chains, trapping the nitroglycerin molecules and keeping them apart. Just like in the dynamite. If you mix in just a small amount of nitrocellulose, you get a stable moldable gel that resists sweating. We're take a little bit of the nitrocellulose, a gun cotton like this much. - Yeah. - Okay, we're gonna start with a little bit. We're gonna drop it in there. You see that it soaks right in. - [Jesse] Yeah, yeah. - Keep on adding bits until it soaks all up and then we'll stir it around to make sure there's no dry spots. But that's not all. This mixture also solves Alfred's problem of yield. The matrix, like the structure that it's being held in is itself explosive. So now you get perfect yield, no sweating, ding, bang, boom. And because the material is a gel, it can be molded into different shapes, perfect for precise controlled mining blasts. - [Jesse] While it's soft like this, we can put it into a shape, and then when it sets, it'll stay that shape. - We enough to do a VE? - Oh yeah, yeah. Let's make a VE. (explosion booms) (mysterious music) - Alfred named it Gelignite. The world's first moldable explosive. With gelignite, dynamite, and the blasting cap in hand, Alfred had fulfilled his oath. He had made explosives safer everyone. He opened factories across the world, in Scotland, France, the United States and beyond. No text By the early 1870s, he was running more than 90 sites in 20 countries. But not everyone was happy. His father never recovered from Emil's death and just weeks after the explosion in Stockholm, Immanuel suffered a stroke. He survived, but was never the same. Immanuel became obsessed with death, often rambling to Alfred about strange inventions, including a scheme to build a network of underground tubes that would carry corpses directly from people's homes to giant incinerators. - His dad never had the success that Alfred's having, you know, financially, and he's being lauded as this great inventor. His dad, I think, is just jealous essentially. But he claims that Alfred had stolen the idea for dynamite from him. - So he says to his dad, \"Rather than regarding this idea as your own, far from it, you laughed at it. Your fatherly love seems to run aground on complacency or vanity. It should not seem strange that I, at the age of 30, will not allow myself to be treated as a schoolboy. It pains me but when it comes to serious matters, I've adopted the rule of acting seriously. Despite the confident front he put up for his father, the truth was that his wealth hadn't made him any happier. He says, \"I'm two steps ahead of my competitors, but the accumulation of money and praise leaves me totally indifferent. My home is where I work, and I work everywhere. I am a nomadic atom with no attachments, no roots, and no real joy in life. By 1876, he couldn't take it anymore. Overwhelmed by the loneliness, he placed an ad. Wealthy, highly educated, elderly gentleman seeks lady of mature age, versed in languages as secretary and supervisor of household. And into his life, entered Bertha Kinsky. She was an idealistic woman, part of the Budding Peace Movement. Together, they took long carriage rides where they discussed the role of science and society and whether it could serve a purpose greater than war. For a moment, Alfred was happy. Hopeful, he asked if her heart was free. But while Alfred was away on business, she left to be with another man in Austria. So Alfred was back to being alone. Alfred was heartbroken. He responded by throwing himself even deeper into his work. Alfred attempted to sell his explosives to the French military, but they weren't interested. Then a year later, when war broke out between France and Prussia, German troops hurled dynamite at the French positions. Now, Alfred received a message. The French wanted to place an order. - One thing that I think is important to like think about in this moment is that people have been stabbed, bruised, shot with gunpowder and all this other stuff, but up till then, it would've been totally foreign to see that level No text of destruction on a human body. - Yeah, it would've been unmatched in kind of human history. - As he starts thinking more about war and becoming involved with like the French military, the German military, the Italian military. They come to him with a problem that's been plaguing them for hundreds of years since the invention of gunpowder, which is that on a battlefield with black powder. When you shoot, it obscures visibility so you don't really know how to shoot again. Like, you can't aim very well. Yeah, one thing you're seeing with the black powder is that every time it explodes, there's just this huge plume of smoke that enemy fighters would be able to see your location. So it's just this big problem where there's like a literal fog of war. Alfred starts contemplating that problem. What he thinks back to is gun cotton. You know, it doesn't create smoke. Can I use gun cotton to replace powder? But the problem with using gun cotton or any high explosive mass in small arms is that it detonates all at once, releasing its energy in a split second, and the pressure inside the barrel spikes faster than the bullet can accelerate. So much of the energy is wasted as heat. Instead of propelling the projectile, it can even destroy the barrel. What Alfred wanted was a propellant that built pressure gradually, so the forest rose smoothly as the bullet traveled down the barrel. So he began experimenting with a new nitroglycerin nitrocellulose mixture. By adding 10 to 20 times more nitrocellulose than a gelignite, he transformed it from a jelly into a tougher substance, one that could be rolled into pasta thin sheets in Italy. They even used pasta makers to do this. These sheets were then stamped into countless tiny little grains. When these grains were packed into a cartridge, they wouldn't fit tightly. Small gaps of air remained between them, but that was actually a good thing. Now, when one grain ignited, a shockwave couldn't just race through the entire charge at once. Instead, each grain had to ignite its neighbor. And the one beside it, and the next one in sequence. This slowed down the burn rate and allowed the pressure to build gradually. So they were able to replicate the effect of gunpowder. And because the fuel was a combination of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose, both of which broke down into clear, stable gases, it burned with little smoke. So Alfred had solved a problem that had plagued armies for centuries, - And to this day, the propellant in much of the world's ammunition is still a combination of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose. Just like Alfred's invention, he called it ballistite, No text the world's first smokeless high energy propellant. Alfred quickly received an order for 300,000 kilograms of ballistite from the Italian army. So he opened a massive armaments factory in Italy and began to fall deeper into the world of warfare. He developed landmines, early gun silencers, and even experimented with one of the first rocket-powered missiles. It flew over four kilometers down range, and allegedly captured this image. - The whole time, he's in contact with Bertha, like the woman who kind of jilted him, and she's become pretty important in the peace movement at the time. She wrote this book called \"Lay Down Your Arms.\" That became kind of a sensation and established these peace congresses across the world. To her, he insisted, \"My rockets are meant not only for war, but also for the rescue of shipwrecked persons.\" He even took it a step further. \"Perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses. On the day that two army corps can mutually annihilate each other in a second. All civilized nations will surely recoil with horror and disband their troops.\" This is a concept that we see a lot of. When people are sure to kill each other with the modern weapons that I've given them, no war will be possible. It's also the same thing that we think about in Oppenheimer. - I feel like we've heard it so many times that you just can't believe it ever. - No. - And then it's just marketing on the part of all these guys who are selling weapons. They don't wanna come across as evil guys who are like, \"I'm gonna make something that'll help you kill more people than ever before.\" I mean, that's kind of the truth of it, - Especially in the dynamite case. It feels like a tremendous misjudgment of human nature. It's like, yeah. - Yeah. - This is not gonna be used for to stop war. And we definitely don't see that in the decades that follow. (jazz music) Between the 1890s and the 1920s, over 7,000 bombings occurred in New York alone. Imagine waking up, opening the paper and seeing another explosion every other day for decades. (sullen music) The most common perpetrators were known as the Dynamite Club. They were part of a deadly new political movement on the rise in America. They rejected industrialization and longed for a simpler world. Today, their name evokes chaos and destruction. But at the time, it was more literal. No ruler, an-ackhos. This was anarchy. They were so crazy and so effective using dynamite that Theodore Roosevelt addressed Congress, and he said, \"The largest threat facing the US is the anarchist threat.\" - Were they intentionally just killing people? - Yeah. Their argument was that, you know, if if one person dies at the hands of an anarchist, 100 people have died in the industrial machine. Yeah. - These people sound crazy. In fact, the entire modern practice of terrorism using spectacular violence to advance a political agenda, often targeting civilians, but that all began with the anarchists and their dynamite. Dynamite unlocked a new scale of destruction previously unimaginable. With only a few sticks in a coat pocket, one person could walk into a crowded street and wreak havoc. What began as an industrial tool had become a weapon of mass murder. In 1927 in Bath, Michigan, a man spent months wiring the town's new elementary school with dynamite. He hid the charges in the basement and crawl spaces, concealed them under floors and behind walls, all while serving as the school board treasurer. Then on the morning of May 18th, just after classes began, he triggered the explosives. As parents and rescuers rushed to the scene, he arrived in a truck packed with more dynamite and shrapnel and detonated. In all, 38 children, six adults, and the attacker died. Another 58 were grievously injured. The deadliest school massacre in American history No text was not a shooting. It was a dynamite attack. Of course, Alfred couldn't know all the ways in which his inventions would be abused, but he had seen the destruction in his own life, and he had heard the pleas to change his ways. So in 1888, when he read that paper, something in him broke. (somber music) Just a few years later, as his health began to fail, as he took pellets of nitroglycerin to ease the pain in his chest, he couldn't shake the thought. So he called his lawyer and wrote a new will. With 94% of his personal fortune, 31.2 million Swedish kronor or about $340 million today, he created a set of prizes for those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind, the Nobel Prize. There were five in total. For chemistry, physics, medicine, literature, and finally, peace. No text (gentle music) On December 10th, 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in Italy. Just as he had always feared, he died alone. At the time of his death, he held 355 patents and ran an empire of 90 factories that produced explosives and armaments across the world. And yet, in his final act, he gave his fortune away for an idea. So did it work? Did it redeem him in the eyes of everyone today? - Have you ever heard the name Alfred Nobel? - Oh yeah. He was the creator of the Nobel Peace Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Nobel Prize. - Anything else? - I should know more. - The Nobel Prize. - Is that it? - Yes. - I'm saying like nothing like dynamite. Don't think about that at all? - Dynamite? - Yeah. He also invented dynamite. - Did not know that. - I didn't know about the dynamite. I knew about the Peace Prize, but that's it. - I think the attempt has been to have him portrayed as somebody who tried to promote new understanding and advances in science. And so that's- - That's his legacy. - Yeah. - Yeah. - It would seem. - I mean, if you're cynical, you say it's a PR move. And are you inclined to be cynical? - I think it must be at least somewhat a PR move. To me, like Nobel Prize has always been like the pinnacle of achievement. If anyone wins the Nobel Prizes, like, yeah, you're done. Like that's all you need to accomplish in life. I mean, in some ways, like maybe he was in control of his legacy. - Yes, and he took control of his legacy. - He did. - He decided he wanted it to be a positive thing. There's a twisted irony to the story. When Alfred Nobel created dynamite, he was trying to make explosive safer to prevent the kind of accident that killed his brother. But by making nitroglycerin easier to handle, he also made it more accessible and that made it more deadly. So why then did he create the Nobel Prizes? Was it out of the goodness of his heart? Or a desire to redeem himself in the eyes of everyone who would come after? I mean, I think the idea that anyone anywhere can be recognised for advancing science, literature or peace is beautiful. - 'This award is not just a piece of metal that you would wear an award that you would keep in your room but, this is really an encouragement for me to go forward and to believe in myself. To know that there are people who are supporting me in this campaign.' So maybe it doesn't matter why he did it, only that he did."}]}

Suddenly, another car pulled up beside him, so the farmer got out. Seconds later, he was murdered. The farmer's name was Mike Wallace. He wasn't killed over money or land. He was killed over a herbicide, a chemical designed to destroy weeds. This herbicide spread fear through rural America, turning farmers against each other, all because it belonged to a certain company. This company's policies, they pitted farmer against farmer, and they could just send henchman to your door. Even if you just had the wrong seeds in your field, they could send you to court and bankrupt you. In effect, they had a farmland monopoly. They owned more than 80% of the seeds planted in the United States. And to get this monopoly, they played the legal system- Colluding with corrupted EPA officials. twisted scientific evidence. Now appears to have been caught red-handed. But the chemicals they were making destroyed the health of communities all over the world. This is a video about Monsanto, one of the biggest agricultural companies in the world. Our investigation is based on publicly available documents, recordings and third-party opinions. All sources are linked in the description. In 1942, a chemist named Franklin D. Jones made an unusual enemy: poison ivy. See, his children had a very violent reaction to the plant. They would get intense rashes and swelling when they brushed up against the ivy, so Jones wanted a way to kill it. He experimented by spraying the ivy with hormones, chemicals that could regulate the plant's functions the same way they do in humans and animals. His hope was that one of these hormones would cause it to die. Unfortunately, many had no effect and others only made the ivy grow better. But then, one day, Jones noticed that certain samples began to show autumn colors, much sooner than they should have. He watched as the vibrant hues turned to twisted shapes, and then within days, these plants shriveled up and died. Jones checked the chemical he sprayed them with, and surprisingly, it was a growth hormone called 2,4-D. It's an acid made up of a ring of six carbons and hydrogens called a benzene ring, with an acid tail. There are also two chlorine atoms in the two and four positions of the ring, which is why it's called 2,4-D. To keep things tidy, we don't have to draw all these carbons and hydrogens, but keep in mind they're still there. Jones realized this synthetic hormone was incredibly potent. Tiny amounts of it would still encourage the ivy to grow, but if he sprayed on a lot of it, 2,4-D would trigger such uncontrollable and unsustainable growth that the poison ivy would die in the process. So effectively, he had plant cancer in a bottle. I was just going to say plant cancer. Right? That's immediately where my brain went. What was even more remarkable was that it only targeted the ivy. The grass around it was barely affected, like it was resistant to 2,4-D. So over the next two years, Jones performed over a hundred different experiments by pouring the herbicide onto many different plant species. And what he figured out was that 2,4-D was really picky. It killed broad-leaved weeds like dandelions, chickweed, and poison ivy, but it virtually ignored crops. Wheat, corn, and barley were all mostly unaffected by 2,4-D because all of these are species of grass. To improve this pickiness further, Jones also tested chemicals similar to 2,4-D. He found that adding another chlorine to the benzene ring, transforming it to 2,4,5-T, left grasses even more unscathed. He was onto something huge. Because up until then, farmers could get rid of weeds one of two ways. Either you spray them with dangerous chemicals like arsenic or you have to pull the weeds out manually. Either way, you're at a loss. But with 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, you could spray your entire crop field, and only the weeds would die. Jones had stumbled upon the first practically viable selective herbicides, so he was quick to patent them in 1945, just as the war was ending. After the Allies victory, the patent secrecy restrictions in most countries were lifted, and it turned out that there were other scientists, both in the US but also in the UK, who discovered these herbicides independently. Soon, the world was blessed with modern miracle weed killers, like Weedone and Weed-A-Bomb and Endo-Weed, all formulations of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T herbicides. This man is ready to kill weeds, because he's going to do it the easy way. These chemicals literally replaced the hoe, and everything from farm fields to railroad tracks and sidewalks. They're essentially what gave us that beautiful green American lawn, just grass and nothing else. Because with these herbicides, dad knew there was no longer any excuse for a weedy lawn. By the late 1940s, their herbicide business had turned into a roughly $10 million industry, No text and everyone wanted in, including one of the biggest chemical companies at the time: Monsanto. One of Monsanto's main herbicide factories was in Nitro, West Virginia, where they pumped out almost a ton of 2,4,5-T a day. By 1949, Monsanto's business was booming, when all of a sudden... the plant exploded. Over a hundred workers rushed out to see a dark cloud rising 40 meters above the factory. They watched as a black stinking powder started raining down on their faces. Within hours, many of these men fell ill. First, they got headaches and nausea, but then their skin began to erupt with bumps, pustules, and acne. The lesions on some of the workers' faces got so bad that Monsanto's on-site doctors had to peel off layers of their skin in an attempt to remove them. The doctors later noted that when these men are in a closed room together, there is a strong odor. They wrote, \"We believe these men are excreting a foreign chemical through their skins.\" But neither the doctors nor anyone else at Monsanto knew what the chemical was because both 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D were marketed as very safe. See, when the herbicides were first getting introduced, Jones, the original inventor, even remarked that he knew people who would accidentally drink or spray the herbicides onto themselves, and they suffered no ill health effects. They were fine. And one of the doctors after him remarked that: \"I've personally taken one half a gram of pure 2,4-D a day for three weeks. You judge the results.\" It was the '40s, so people were a bit crazy. But yeah, it seemed pretty safe. Back at Nitro, Monsanto analyzed all the other ingredients they were using to make 2,4,5-T, but they still couldn't find what was causing their workers' skin to erupt in this way. This is where their search seemingly stopped. With no culprit, the conditions at the plant stayed mostly the same, and Monsanto just offered their workers a choice: either you'll keep on working with 2,4,5-T or you can take the gate. For many, this was no choice at all since there were hardly any other jobs in town. So, most of the workers stayed with something inside the factory, poisoning them for years to come. It wasn't until 1957, 8 years after the explosion, that a German dermatologist, Karl Schulz, found himself treating patients with similar-looking lesions and acne. He wasn't surprised by the symptoms because many of these patients worked in 2,4,5-T factories around Hamburg. But when Schulz would test these ingredients from the instruction list on rabbit ears he had at the lab, he would get no reactions. And this puzzled him. How do these ingredients do nothing in his own tests, but at the same time cause these painful skin disorders inside 2,4,5-T factories? Well, to make 2,4,5-T, you start with tetrachlorobenzene, a benzene ring with four chlorine atoms attached to it. These chlorine atoms are very electronegative, so they want to steal electrons from nearby atoms. Luckily for them, the six carbons in the benzene ring are all sharing their electrons in these fuzzy donut-shaped clouds around the ring. That's what this circle in the diagram is meant to represent. The chlorine atoms pull on this electron cloud, bringing it closer to themselves, and as a result, the carbons in the benzene ring become slightly positively charged and the chlorine's slightly negatively charged. Now, if you heat up tetrachlorobenzene with sodium hydroxide, one of the negative hydroxide ions will want to bind to one of the slightly positively charged carbons in the benzene ring. And to do that, it forces out the chlorine atom, taking its place. This creates trichlorophenol, or TCP, a key ingredient in making the herbicide. From here, if you keep the reaction at 170 degrees Celsius, you can add a series of chemicals to grow out this oxygen tail into an acid, giving you 2,4,5-T. On paper, this is all there is. If you follow the exact steps here and control the conditions, then none of these ingredients will explain the horrible face eruptions that the Nitro workers were experiencing. But Schulz wasn't satisfied with this. Maybe the conditions aren't perfect. Maybe there is something in this process, some secret reaction that is contaminating the whole chemical supply. Ideally, the industrial process of transforming tetrachlorobenzene into 2,4,5-T should happen at 170 degrees Celsius. But if the temperature gets any higher, even just a few degrees higher, there is suddenly enough energy in the system for two molecules of TCP to fuse together. This creates a molecule commonly known as dioxin. It forms only in trace amounts, so you might expect to end up with roughly one or two molecules of dioxin for every hundred thousand molecules of 2,4,5-T. It seemed too small to be a problem. Nevertheless, Schulz decided to test it. He took some TCP, this time contaminated with trace amounts of dioxin, and rubbed it into his own skin, and he got the same acne as the workers at the Nitro plant. Once Schulz realized the threat here, he immediately contacted all the big chemical producers in Germany, and one of these German companies even sent letters to both Monsanto and Dow, the other big herbicide producer in the US, and they warned them that the acne-causing effects are stemming from pollution through byproducts, referring to dioxin. They even listed when exactly during the process the contamination was happening and what to do to prevent it. Yet, Monsanto denied ever getting these letters, and Dow said they somehow misfiled them. Regardless, it was obvious to both companies that something in the production of 2,4,5-T was poisoning their workers. No text But Monsanto didn't warn the public about the danger, perhaps because the herbicides were about to make them a whole lot of money. In 1961, the president of South Vietnam was at war with the newly founded Viet Cong. This guerrilla force was set on overthrowing his rule and uniting Vietnam under a communist regime. The Viet Cong were masters of the jungle. They laid deadly traps for their enemies and ambushed them using underground tunnels. South Vietnam was losing the war, so the president faced a choice: either accept defeat in the jungle or destroy it. He reached out to his allies, the US, and asked them for help. Soon, they came in flying with thousands of barrels of herbicide. This was the start of Operation Ranch Hand. The US's herbicide of choice was Agent Orange, a 50/50 split of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T supplied by the US's biggest chemical manufacturers. The largest supplier by volume was Monsanto. Agent Orange ravaged through South Vietnam destroying 20% of the jungles. And civilians and soldiers on both sides got sprayed with it too, mostly by accident. The government assured them that it is not toxic to humans, animals, or drinking water, but Monsanto and Dow knew otherwise. See during Ranch Hand, they secretly exchanged information on their herbicides. And in one of the letters, Dow acknowledged that dioxin, which had been contaminating 2,4,5-T for years was \"the most toxic compound they have ever experienced\", and that even trace amounts of it caused incapacitating acne. By 1965, it was obvious that both companies understood what sort of threat dioxin was, and yet there are no records that Monsanto or Dow ever sent communication to the US government warning them about the threat. In fact, Dow's vice president reportedly said, \"If the government learns about this, the whole industry will suffer.\" As a result, the US sprayed South Vietnam with 72 million liters of Agent Orange, within which was just 80 liters of dioxin. And even though that doesn't seem like much, the damage was irreparable. Civilians and soldiers on both sides suffered from skin diseases and cancer. Children were born with physical and mental disabilities. By some estimates, as many as three million people suffered from the effects of Agent Orange. This outraged the public. In 1967, 5,000 scientists signed a petition to the president condemning his use of the herbicides. And Monsanto was under scrutiny too, because regulators were catching on to the dioxin contained in 2,4,5-T. No text The herbicide was about to be phased out, compromising their bottom line. Monsanto needed a miracle, and they needed it fast. Their idea was to replace 2,4,5-T with a safer herbicide. But after nine years of research, they weren't getting anywhere. All of the scientists in the Agricultural department referred to this new initiative as a dead area. One of the last remaining scientists on the project was John E. Franz, and by early 1970, he was about to give it up too. But before abandoning the project, France decided to do one final set of experiments, so he thought up 19 possible assets that could maybe work as herbicides and decided to test them out. He prepped the first herbicide, but nothing happened. The plant was completely fine, and the herbicide had no activity. Then he decided to test the second herbicide, and he applied it to a plant. It was 10 times more powerful than any herbicide the team had ever seen. And allegedly, it made the plants super... It made the plants super nasty. That was disgusting. This miracle compound was glyphosate, a phosphonic acid group on one end and a carboxyl group on the other with a nitrogen, hydrogen, or amino group in between. To make sure it was commercially feasible, Franz and his colleague set up tests in these outdoor fields. And as one of the scientists was getting back to these test sites, he saw the results from the plane. It was clear as day. All he could do is write Eureka across the performance report. It was the best herbicide they'd ever seen. What made it so great at killing plants? Well, for plants to survive, they use a chemical pathway, a series of reactions to create three important amino acids, acids without which they die. This process is known as the Shikimate pathway because it starts with shikimic acid named after the Japanese Shikimi flower. During one of the steps, two acids, S3P and PEP need to transform into a third compound, but they can only do that with the help of an enzyme called EPSPS, which catalyzes the reaction and helps the two molecules combine. However, if glyphosate is present during this reaction, it will begin to mimic PEP because they have a very similar geometry. And because of that, glyphosate actually binds first to EPSPS blocking it from acting as a catalyst. Now, the acids can't transform and the whole Shikimate pathway is destroyed. Without it, there are no amino acids and the plant dies. Crucially, the Shikimate pathway is unique to plants and things like bacteria and fungi. Humans and animals don't have it. In fact, we have to eat foods that contain these three amino acids. But for Monsanto, this was good news because they could market that glyphosate targets an enzyme found in plants, but not in humans or pets. After decades of toxic products, Monsanto finally had one which they were sure was safe. And research was also showing that after you spray glyphosate, the microorganisms in the soil break it down into safe byproducts. It was biodegradable. Glyphosate was perfect, so they wasted no time in getting it on the market. In 1974, Monsanto had a new hit herbicide... Roundup. Roundup is better. It goes through the plant to kill it, tops and rhizomes. My roots hurt real bad. Hank, Hank! Roundup. No root, no weed, no problem. Farmers loved it because unlike 2,4-D, glyphosate killed every weed, not just broad-leaved ones, but grassy too. It allowed them to practice something called no-till farming. See, usually to get rid of weeds, you'd have to plow up the entire field before planting anything, and that would hurt the soil, and it was also just a lot work. But with Roundup, what you do is you spray the whole field, everything dies, and then you just plant directly into the residue. It was easier, faster, and cheaper. And Roundup was safe to use too. They marketed it as safer than table salt and safe enough to drink, basically. Roundup can be used where kids and pets will play and breaks down into natural materials. By the late eighties, Monsanto was selling seven million pounds of Roundup and making a billion dollars each year. And they weren't going to share a penny of that money with anyone. See, with other herbicides, like for example, Alachlor, which was moderately popular at the time, you can tweak the molecule a bit here or there, and you still get a very potent weed killer, so if you patented a specific herbicide, your competitors could still use hundreds of its close relatives, which would still work perfectly well without violating your patent rights. But glyphosate was different, if you were to modify the molecule in any way, its herbicidal properties were completely gone, so Monsanto could rest easy knowing that until the year 2000, they would be the only ones able to sell it. But there was a little problem with glyphosate. See, unlike 2,4-D, which only killed broadleaved weeds, Roundup kills everything. I sprayed some of my own houseplants here and well, you can see the results. Chances are if it's green, Roundup is going to kill it. No text And this was a problem because farmers could only really spray Roundup on their field twice, either right before planting the seeds or right after a harvest. But for Monsanto, this wasn't as much of a problem. See, they thought if we could somehow make the crops like soybean or corn resistant to Roundup, well then farmers could spray it on their field during the whole year, and it would keep killing the weeds, but not the Roundup resistant crops. Crops which Monsanto could sell them. And as a result, they would have a complete monopoly over both the herbicide and the seed supply. Monsanto's idea was this, if glyphosate blocks the EPSPS enzyme in plants then they could edit the plant's DNA so that the cells just create more EPSPS. If there's enough of the enzyme then glyphosate can't block all of it, and so the plant can still survive. They tried this out on petunias, but it didn't work. The flowers would survive a tiny amount of Roundup, but a normal dose would still kill them. Monsanto was kind of stumped, and they didn't have time to rest, because while glyphosate and Roundup were under their patents, a Roundup resistant seed wasn't. And their competitors knew this. In 1985, a company called Calgene published a paper in nature showing that they made tobacco slightly resistant to glyphosate. The paper showed promise, but more importantly, it made it clear to Monsanto that they were running out of time. Their researchers were desperate calling this patent race the \"Manhattan Project\". And then one of the engineers had a genius idea. Monsanto had a ton of these factories where they were converting phosphate into glyphosate, and they had a lot of sludge leaching out of these factories, so if there was anything living around these factories in this sludge, there was a chance it was resistant to glyphosate. The researchers went to one of these factories, scooped it out, and found a strain of salmonella in there, which was surprising to them because salmonella usually relies on the Shikimate pathway, but here it was thriving in glyphosate. Monsanto's scientists isolated the salmonella's genetic sequence, and found that it had evolved a way to mutate the shape of its EPSPS enzyme so that glyphosate couldn't bind to it and block the Shikimate pathway. The scientists took that salmonella DNA and loaded it onto a gene gun, not this one here, but it's actually surprisingly similar. See, they placed thousands of these salmonella DNA strips onto microscopic gold particles in the gene gun, which they then fired into the plant tissue all over, at 1,400 kilometers per hour. The gold particles would bombard the plant cells, and some of them would make it into the nucleus. Here, the DNA detaches from the gold, and it integrates itself into the plant's chromosomes. Now, every time this cell divides, it copies over the new EPSPS gene. Monsanto scientists planted seeds with these genes out in the field and sprayed them with Roundup, but nothing happened. The soybean was resistant. Monsanto made sure to act quickly soon after they found even more potent bacteria, and they were able to make other crop species immune too. And by 1998, they had patents for glyphosate resistant canola, corn, and cotton. They called this lineup of GMO seeds Roundup Ready. These Roundup Ready seeds took over the market in an instant. Already by 2001, more than 70% of all soybeans grown in the US were Monsanto's with Roundup making them more than $2.5 billion a year. It was the best-selling agricultural product ever. And every farmer could join in on this Roundup plus Roundup Ready revolution just by signing Monsanto's Technology Use Agreement. I've got one of these agreements from 2011 here, and I just wanted to read some terms. The grower or the farmer who accepts and wants to use these seeds agrees to not save or clean any crop produced from the seed for planting. And the farmer also agrees not to supply the seed produced from the seed to anyone for planting, meaning you cannot save the seeds you bought last year to plant this year, and you also cannot share or sell your seeds to anyone else. Here's another one, the farmer agrees to identify and allow Monsanto and its representatives access to the land farmed by the grower or the farmer. And this allows Monsanto to examine and take samples of the crops, crop residue or the seeds located therein. And here's a final one, the grower accepts the terms of the following notice requirements by signing this agreement, or by opening a bag of seeds. So you're agreeing to these terms even just by opening a bag of seeds. If you thought that this contract was crazy, you should see the stuff that we sign up to today online. I have some terms and conditions here from a social media website. Here's what it says. \"We may collect biometric identifiers, and we may infer your attributes, such as age range and gender.\" So they're able to scan your face and sell that data to advertisers. And just in the last couple of months, companies have been making these aggressive pushes to their terms and conditions to try and get more of your data, and they can use it to train AI models or just sell it to data brokers. And this doesn't just mean annoying ads and spam emails and phone calls. Law enforcement can buy your data, and normal people can buy it too. Even stuff like your location history. And all of that is perfectly legal, but luckily you can take steps to prevent it with the help of today's sponsor, Incogni. See, I started using Incogni in June. Look, you can see that they already contacted 46 data brokers to delete my personal data, and 42 of those requests have been completed, and I've actually been getting fewer spam emails. The new thing is that they now offer an unlimited plan with custom removals. So if you are browsing online and see a website with your data, even though it shouldn't have the data, you can ask one of Incogni's experts to manually take it down for you. And if you want to extend that sort of protection to someone else, they also have a family plan that supports up to five members.

I want to thank Incogni for sponsoring this part of the video, and now back to farmers and the terms and conditions they had to sign. Well, couldn't farmers just decide not to use Monsanto's seeds and herbicide? No text The thing was, you have Roundup Ready seeds and you spray them with Roundup, everything's going to be fine on your end. But your neighbor doesn't have Roundup Ready seeds, so if your herbicide drifts over to your neighbor's side, it's going to kill his plants. So neighbors were concerned thinking their crops were going to be lost, so they got Roundup Ready as well, and soon enough, Monsanto controlled the whole market. And the control didn't end there. As one seed grower from Ohio remembers it, Monsanto's salesman would tell people they could either sign on, or they'd all be out of business within the next two years. Monsanto was going to dominate the entire seed industry, and there was nothing anybody could do about it. So hundreds of thousands of farmers signed the deal, and it wasn't a good one. One evening in late July of 2004, an Indiana farmer named Dave Runyon was relaxing at home when two men knocked on his door. They led me to believe that they were doing a survey for a magazine. They wanted to know what kind of crops I planted. They wanted to know what kind of herbicides I used, the seed I bought and purchased and used. Runyon wasn't interested, so he decided to shut the door, when he heard one of the men say, \"I think he's guilty.\" Runyon didn't know what they meant, but a few months later, he got a letter from Monsanto saying that he had seven days to turn over all of his business records to the company. He was shocked, because Runyon was one of the few farmers that never signed a contract with Monsanto, and yet here they were threatening to sue him for patent infringement. Apparently, someone had tipped Monsanto off that Runyon had been replanting their seeds illegally, and farmers all across the country were getting the same types of letters. Honestly, it's kind of hard to overstate how much Monsanto tried to control farmers. They sent private detectives and ex-cops to inspect farms all over the US, waving their terms and conditions of the contract into farmers' faces to let them onto their property. They hired plane and helicopter pilots to survey the farmlands from above for signs of infringement. The lawsuits, the threats. How could people possibly stand up to them? And they even had a company hotline, 1-800-ROUNDUP, that farmers could call to snitch on their neighbors. It still exists. 1-800-ROUNDUP. You're calling them now? I think I got it right. If you have information about the misuse of seed or a compliance issue, please press three. That phone number was in existence in the same time that we're talking about there, where people could rat out their neighbor. As Runyon himself puts it, \"There is much mistrust in the countryside today. You never know who might report on you. You could actually willfully plant unauthorized seed in somebody's land if you want to destroy them.\" Now, in 2010, Monsanto responded to farmers' concerns about these investigations and released a commitment statement regarding their patents. They mentioned their pledge to transparency and ethical behavior, properly introducing themselves with displayed identification, and not exercising their patent rights when only trace amounts of their seed is present in a farmer's field. While Monsanto ultimately ended up letting Runyon go, by 2013, they sued over 400 farmers, raking in over $20 million. Many of these farmers went bankrupt, and countless others settled with Monsanto out of court even if they were innocent, because they just couldn't risk the legal fees. You know, they were actually influencing radio stations at one point, and the radio stations would publicly say the name of the people who were saving Roundup seeds on air. That sounds like a supervillain plot, really. Yeah, well people actually started calling them Mon-satan, so... This culture of fear and paranoia turned neighbors against each other, especially in communities where some farmers didn't wish to use Monsanto's herbicide system. One of those farmers was Mike Wallace. See, Mike had a field of soybean here that wasn't resistant to Monsanto's herbicide, but his neighbor who was also growing soybean did use Monsanto's system. Now, to be clear, this herbicide wasn't glyphosate itself, it was Monsanto's other herbicide product called Dicamba, but it was still packaged in this Roundup and Roundup Ready system. Now, one day Mike noticed that some of his soybean was dying, and he suspected it was the herbicide from the neighboring farm drifting over, killing his soybean, and he could tell this was the case because the weeds underneath the neighbor's soybean were dying, allegedly because of the herbicide. And he believed this caused him around a hundred thousand dollars in damages, but the neighbor denied that it was his fault. Now, the tensions between the two farms grew, so Mike wanted to chat with one of the workers from the farm to discuss the situation. They met on a country field road near both farms, and what happened next isn't really clear. Things got sour quickly. Allegedly, Mike grabbed the worker's arm, so the worker pulled back and pulled out his gun, \"shooting Wallace until the gun was empty\". Similar kinds of tragedies were happening all over the world. Monsanto infiltrated farming communities in India, Argentina, Canada, Brazil, and even Vietnam. No text By the 2010s, they were an almost untouchable monopoly. Then out of the blue on March 20th 2015, an independent science panel called the International Agency for Research on Cancer, or IARC, came out with this, a paper saying, \"Glyphosate is probably carcinogenic to humans.\" The most popular weed killer in the world may cause cancer. IARC's classification of glyphosate as a probable carcinogen. damage to chromosomes and DNA in human cells. This came as a shock to everyone, especially Monsanto. They don't know how IARC could reach a conclusion such as this one. See, other big health organizations, like the US Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, and even the World Health Organization, which is actually the parent organization to IARC, both claimed that glyphosate posed no carcinogenic risk to humans and animals. I think the IARC designation took the public by such huge surprise, because Monsanto had really done such a good job for 40-plus years convincing the world that this stuff was safer than table salt. Monsanto was furious about this ruling, so on the same day, they sent a scathing letter to the World Health Organization complaining how this classification needs to be rectified immediately. They claimed IARC chose to disregard dozens of studies, and that conclusions on glyphosate must be non-biased, thorough, and based on quality science. Soon after, five review papers came out bashing the IARC classification and criticizing their decision. So why would IARC disagree with all the other agencies, and why would they ignore so many studies? Well, this is exactly the question California lawyer Brent Wisner wanted to answer. Wisner had been looking into Monsanto for a while now. Allegedly, Roundup was causing a decline in the bee population, so he thought he could make a case out of it. But one day, one of Wisner's colleagues told him that her cousin-in-law had been using Roundup on his farm for as long as she could remember, and then both he and his dog developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or NHL, a type of cancer targeting the lymphatic system, and he died in late 2015. He didn't stop using it until he was too weak to do anything. He didn't think there was any danger with Roundup. See, the IARC paper that came out saying glyphosate is a probable carcinogen actually pointed out that the strongest evidence was for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. And reports of Roundup users getting diagnosed with NHL were popping up more frequently. This seemed like more than just a coincidence. Wisner thought he had a case, but Monsanto was a corporate giant he couldn't tackle alone, so he teamed up with other lawyers, and also an investigative journalist who'd been reporting on Monsanto for decades. So there's a lot to write about. I spent a lot of time at Monsanto headquarters. It became pretty clear, \"This company really doesn't care about its customers.\" Right, okay. Together, this group of lawyers started a lawsuit against Monsanto, and they forced them to hand over their company documents. Monsanto had to comply, and so the lawyers got access to their internal emails, memos, and safety studies. Saying one thing publicly and saying something completely different internally. The duplicity, the deception, is just jaw-dropping, really. In 1983, Monsanto submitted a glyphosate toxicology study to the EPA to get it classified as safe, but the data was showing that mice receiving higher doses of glyphosate were developing rare kidney tumors. The EPA was obviously worried with this, and they wanted to classify glyphosate as a possible human carcinogen. So they asked Monsanto to do more studies. And Monsanto fought back against that. \"No, you just need to trust what we're telling you. You're reading the data wrong,\" et cetera et cetera. Monsanto wouldn't comply, and they pushed back against the EPA until 1989, when the EPA suddenly changed its mind. They said, \"A repeat of the mouse oncogenicity will not be required at this time.\" And instead, in 1991, the EPA classified glyphosate as having evidence of non-carcinogenicity for humans. The cancer concern in mice was never made public, and this new classification certainly helped push Roundup sales, at least until more independent research came in. See, one of the most influential research papers on Roundup actually came out in the year 2000. It was the Safety Evaluation and Risk Assessment of the Herbicide Roundup and its Active Ingredient Glyphosate for Humans, commonly just called Williams, Kroes, and Munro after its authors. This was the landmark paper on glyphosate safety, which concluded that Roundup herbicide does not pose a health risk to humans. This paper was cited over 1200 times, which is a lot. And it was considered then by regulators of the foundational research paper to say that glyphosate was safe, this independent paper. Except the paper wasn't independent at all. See, Monsanto's director of the toxicology group, William Heydens, was listed on the paper as someone who provided scientific support. So in a 2017 deposition, Wisner and his fellow lawyers decided to ask Heydens about it. Were your contributions in your view to the Williams paper substantial? No, they were not. As I said, they were editorial, just to make it easier to read. But here's how Heydens referred to his involvement in the paper internally. \"I have sprouted several new gray hairs during the writing of this thing,\" or \"I'll strangle Kroes or Williams if they ask for any rewrites!!\" And much later, \"We would be keeping the cost down by us doing the writing and they would just edit and sign their names, so to speak. Recall that is how we handled Williams Kroes and Munro.\" And they celebrated when it was finally done. You see in their internal documents, they talk about how this is going to be our defense, glyphosate around the world. The patterns of Monsanto's manipulation were just popping up everywhere. They tried to change glyphosate cancer classifications at different agencies. They seemingly colluded with corrupt EPA officials to try and kill opposing research. And they ghost-wrote safety studies. By mid 2017, Wisner released all of these internal documents to the public, now known as the Monsanto Papers. People were furious. Newly released docs show Monsanto executives colluding with corrupted EPA officials. Would try to influence media and science reports. Monsanto appears to have been caught red-handed. We have a paper trail that goes back to the 1980s. Stakes for Monsanto are extremely high. Soon, lawyers were overwhelmed with calls from cancer patients who used Roundup and got diagnosed with NHL. They wished to be included in the lawsuit. By the end of the year, more than 3000 victims had signed onto the case. But Monsanto tried to do everything to dismantle these carcinogen claims. You remember the five independent papers that came out bashing the IARC decision to call glyphosate a probable carcinogen? Well, the main review article there was ghostwritten by Monsanto. So you could see this paper getting edited and changed by people who worked for Monsanto. And it has been frustrating to see journals basically at every step of the way declining to retract. That paper is still online today, and Monsanto went all the way to discredit anyone who is opposing their view with something called their 'Let Nothing Go' Strategy. Let Nothing Go is essentially like, let nothing go. Somebody tweets online, Roundup causes cancer, you don't let that go. You have an onslaught of people responding to that. They had whole training operations where they would bring in nutritionists and academics and other people to train them what to say and how to say it. I do not believe that glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer. You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you. You want to drink some? We have some here. I'd be happy to actually. But not really. Not really? I know it wouldn't hurt me. I mean, if you say so, I have some glyphosate. No, no, I'm not stupid. But they very much became an army that Monsanto could deploy when a news article came out, for instance. Are we going to get some comments under this video that are actually written by Monsanto? I wouldn't be surprised. But all of the confusion Monsanto tried to create around glyphosate wasn't enough. By the summer of 2018, the truth was out and over 11,000 plaintiffs filed lawsuits against Monsanto. This was going to destroy them. But unfortunately, Monsanto had an escape plan. Just as the first lawsuit against them was starting, they signed an acquisition deal with German chemical giant, Bayer. Monsanto cashed in, the executives rode off into the sunset, and Bayer was left holding the bag. Why would Bayer buy Monsanto? If it's so obvious that they have hundreds of thousands of plaintiffs waiting for a verdict, why would a company do something like that? Well, I think that's the big question that the investors are asking, or have asked. Why in God's name did you do this? Why did you do this? I think it was Wall Street Journal that had a headline, Worst Acquisition in History, or something like that. Bayer stock tanked immediately after the acquisition, and things only got worse for them. A few months later, the first case against the Monsanto-Bayer company went to trial. The plaintiff was Dewayne Lee Johnson, who had developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma after accidentally getting doused with Roundup at work. The jury faced with evidence from the Monsanto Papers sided with Johnson, awarding him $289 million in damages, and Bayer had to pay up. By 2025, Bayer had to settle more than a hundred thousand cancer lawsuits for the damages caused by Monsanto's Roundup, amounting to over $10 billion in settlements. Monsanto, which is now owned by Germany's Bayer, denies any wrongdoing. No text And they don't accept that Roundup could have caused the plaintiffs' cancer. So after all this publicity and scandal, how dangerous is Roundup really? My question has always been, if it doesn't cause cancer and it's not dangerous and there's no real risk to human health, why in God's name would Monsanto have to spend millions and millions and millions of dollars to create ghostwritten studies, and hire PR companies to ghostwrite articles online? And why would you have to engage in so much deception if you truly had a safe product, right? Well, according to IARC, one of the biggest concerns with glyphosate is genotoxicity. Some studies have shown that if you get overexposed to glyphosate, like many farmers would, then the chemical might substantially damage the DNA in your cells, which is a common mechanism of action for many carcinogens. And other studies have actually pointed to the shikimate pathway. Again, we don't use it, but the bacteria in our gut do. So if you ingest trace amounts of glyphosate, for example, through your food, it could disrupt your gut's microbiome. If you can disrupt the enzyme in the microflora in your gut, the EPSP enzyme, the synthase, it could have all sorts of effects. Now, IARC never specified at what dose glyphosate actually becomes dangerous. Just that overall glyphosate is a probable carcinogen. And to put it into context, the other things in the same classification category are eating red meat or high temperature frying or pulling a night shift. But these are lower than the number one category, which is a certain carcinogen. And here of course you have alcohol and tobacco and sunlight. And to give you context from our previous episode on Forever Chemicals, PFOA was a category one, so a certain carcinogen, but PFOS is actually a category 2B, which is lower than glyphosate at only a possible carcinogen. From the data I've seen, glyphosate doesn't seem to be a particularly potent carcinogen, but high exposure to glyphosate is certainly associated with a modest increase in your ability to get certain types of cancers. And people who have higher exposures are clearly at higher risk. Yeah. However, the EPA and many other organizations like the European Food Safety Authority still disagree with the IARC and claim that glyphosate isn't a likely carcinogen. But the courts in the United States have repeatedly told the EPA that they're not doing a proper analysis, they're not doing a proper assessment of glyphosate, they're not following their own rules. You said something like 50% of the papers that were about glyphosate safety and research and toxicity were probably industry funded. Yeah, that's just a guess off the top of my head. Honestly, it could be much higher than 50%. I certainly do not think it's lower than that. There's just always a desire by these companies to control the science. Today, Bayer still denies that glyphosate is a carcinogen. They would still tell you, they don't think there's anything wrong with it. Yeah. When my book came out, Bayer reached out to me, they sent me an email. And it was really kind of quite strange. It was like, \"Congratulations. We've read your book and we've learned a lot.\" I think Bayer feels different. And Bayer actually removed glyphosate from commercial products. So this bottle of Roundup here doesn't even have glyphosate in it anymore. Part of the reason for that must be the public backlash and the lawsuits, but the other reason is that it doesn't work that well anymore. We overuse glyphosate. See, since the 1970s, more than 60 species of weed have become resistant to glyphosate, just like that first salmonella sample found near the factory. What do they put in those Roundup sprays, if not glyphosate? Well, mostly full circle, so it's 2,4-D. Isn't that crazy? Well, you know, many people will probably go through life not being affected in the slightest by glyphosate. But others may develop cancer or other disease, and that's why it's really important to protect the most sensitive individuals. I think another part of the problem here is how a company as big as Monsanto can just infiltrate academia. They have these big resources so they can just push around scientists and manipulate results. They create so much confusion, and then they just avoid the punishment. When you don't create firewalls between the regulated and the regulators, you have created distrust in science. Inherently, science is always going to be political. It's never going to be disconnected from the realities of the world, it's always socially constructed. But we can do a lot of things to put rules and regulations in place to try and make sure that there's a better sense of independence and disconnection between this. I want to shout out two books, Carey Gillam's 'The Monsanto Papers' and Bart Elmore's 'Seed Money'. They were both incredibly valuable in researching this topic. And I also want to shout out people in the comments of our previous video on PFAS suggesting that we should cover Monsanto. Thank you for suggesting that idea. And thank you as always for watching."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: Paul Dirac's relativistic wave equation"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- In 1928, a young man shuffled onto a stage in Germany to present a lecture on his recent work. He had a slightly unusual presentation style. Physicist Eugene Wigner described the lecture as detached, almost like a recitation of a technical text. He said, \"The man spoke without giving any sign of enjoying his own lecture.\" But the work this strange unassuming man presented was about to send some of the most famous quantum physicists of the 20th century spiraling. (suspenseful music) After the lecture, Werner Heisenberg described the man's theory as, \"The saddest chapter in modern physics.\" Heisenberg also wrote to Niels Bohr and said, \"I find the present situation quite absurd and, on that account, almost out of despair, I have taken up another field.\" Legend has it that Wolfgang Pauli even announced that he was abandoning quantum physics, and then he started writing a utopian novel. What had the young man said to disrupt the world of quantum mechanics so profoundly? But he had been working on a problem that physicists are still tackling today. The unification of Einstein's relativity and quantum mechanics, and his work had revealed something troubling, a particle unlike any scene in the world, a particle with negative energy. (suspenseful music) In 1905, Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity. It was based on the simple idea that for anyone moving with constant speed, the laws of physics should be the same, and this includes any measurement of the speed of light. So, it doesn't matter how you're moving relative to a beam of light, you should measure its speed to be 300 million meters per second. This means that things that we ordinarily think of as fixed, like time and space, have to transform, so that the speed of light is always measured to have the same value. In making this discovery, Einstein realized that space and time are not really separate dimensions at all. They're linked in a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime. (pensive music) When Einstein applied this idea to an object emitting light, he found something peculiar. When an object loses energy by emitting photons, its mass must also decrease, and the change in the object's mass is equal to the energy of the photons emitted divided by the speed of light squared. In other words, he found that energy must be equal to mc squared. E equals mc squared. - [Einstein] Mass and energy are but different manifestations of the same thing. - So, a particle's total energy comes from its momentum and its rest mass, giving it new relationship between energy and momentum. (pensive music) Now, if we take the square root of both sides, we get an expression for the energy of a particle in terms of its mass and momentum. And if we plot energy versus momentum in a single dimension, we get this curve, where mc squared, the rest mass energy of the object, is the lowest possible value for energy. But really, when we took the square root, we should have put a plus/minus out front, which would give us two curves: one for positive energies and another for negative energies. But we don't observe things that have energy less than 0. I mean, what would that even mean? So, in classical physics, the solution is simple. You just ignore the negative energy solutions. They can't physically represent anything, right, Casper? - Well, sure, that sounds right. But around the same time that Einstein was coming up with his special theory of relativity, physicists began observing some strange phenomena in atomic physics that were overthrowing all of these classical assumptions. First of all, they noticed that when looking at the energy levels of subatomic particles, like electrons, they weren't continuous at all, they were discrete. No text And they also didn't just behave as particles, but as waves. So, if you would take electrons and fire them through two narrow slits, then they would create interference patterns, just like light does. What they were discovering was the new field of quantum mechanics. (suspenseful music) And in 1926, Erwin Schrodinger formalized this field by coming up with his now-famous wave equation, which describes how quantum mechanical systems evolve over time. - This was the most radical new theory of the 20th century, and would remain so. This is not a bit like Newton or a bit like Maxwell. This was radically new. - [Casper] The equation solution, called the wave function, psi, does not describe a particle with a precise position and momentum as classical laws would. But instead, the modular squared can give us the probability of finding the particle in a specific location at a specific time. - Deriving the Schrodinger equation is actually surprisingly simple. Just start by writing down the total energy, which, for a free particle, is just its kinetic energy, 1/2 mv squared. And we can rewrite it in terms of momentum, mass times velocity. So kinetic energy is just momentum squared divided by 2m. Now, we're going to make this quantum, and to do that, we need two things. The first is the wave function, psi, which describes how particles act as waves at quantum scales. And the second is something called a quantum operator. This is just a mathematical tool that extracts information from the wave function to reveal a specific property of the particle, like its position, energy, or momentum. The operators for energy and momentum look like this. By inputting these operators, we can make each side of the equation act on the wave function, and that gives us the Schrodinger equation for a free particle. (pensive music) For particles that aren't free, like electrons in atoms, you need to factor in potential energy, too, which gives you the full Schrodinger equation. (pensive music) - But there are some places where it doesn't produce the right prediction. For example, take the element gold. The Schrodinger equation suggests that it should be a silver gray color, just like all the other metals. But it's not, I mean, it's gold. And for mercury, the Schrodinger equation predicts that it should be a solid at room temperature, but it's a liquid. So, what is wrong? Well, I'll give you a hint, because both gold and mercury are heavy elements. - [Derek] They have a high number of protons in their nuclei, which attract orbiting electrons more strongly. So, if you're thinking in a classical sense, the electrons would be bound tighter in, and they'd be whizzing around at higher speeds than in other elements. And for electrons in some orbits, those speeds start to get a little too close to the speed of light. (pensive music) So, let's go back to the Schrodinger equation. There, we had the kinetic energy was p squared over 2m. But for particles moving at relativistic speeds close to the speed of light, that equation isn't the right one. The correct equation is the energy momentum relation from special relativity. - Schrodinger's equation is not consistent with the theory of relativity, so it's... Technically, it's not right. (pensive music) - So, the solution seems simple enough. Just start with the relativistic energy momentum relation and use that to derive a new wave equation. (pensive music) Well, this is exactly what a physicist named Oskar Klein did in 1926. He subbed in the same energy and momentum operators that Schrodinger used, and found this equation. (pensive music) Klein's work was pretty well-received by a number of his colleagues. In fact, it turned out the two other physicists, Walter Gordon and Vladimir Fock, had independently arrived at the same equation in that same year. It became known as the Klein-Gordon equation, which was a bit of a burn for Fock. (graphic whooshing) (graphic twinkling) But that's often how it goes. You do all the hard work and then no one notices. Things have changed a little since Fock's time, but the key to recognition is still visibility. And these days, that means having a website.

I wanna thank Hostinger for sponsoring this part of the video. And now, back to Klein, Gordon, and Fock. No text The Klein-Gordon-Fock equation even made its way over to one of the fathers of quantum physics, Niels Bohr, who must have been impressed, because at the 1927 Solvay Conference, Bohr was chatting to a promising young physicist about what he was working on. The young man said, \"I'm trying to get a relativistic theory of the electron.\" Bohr replied, \"But Klein has already solved this problem.\" The young man disagreed. So, who was this bold 25-year-old? He was Paul Dirac, a man who Bohr would later give the nickname The Strangest Man because he was truly one of a kind. - First time I went to Princeton, I met a couple who invited Dirac and his wife. And Dirac, for the whole meal, which lasted three hours, didn't say a single word. Not one word. He wasn't sulky, he wasn't angry. He just saw no reason to speak. - That's crazy. - [Derek] Dirac was a man of so few words that his colleagues invented a special unit, a Dirac, equivalent to speaking one word per hour. Legend also has it that he liked to relax by climbing trees in three-piece suits. And that wasn't his only strange hobby. As a student, Dirac had attended seminars on Einstein's theory of relativity, and he'd kind of fallen in love with it. He was impressed by the elegance and beauty of its mathematics. To Dirac, this got to the core of what a good theory must do. He once said, \"It is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment.\" (pensive music) - [Casper] Do you know why Dirac was so drawn to relativity? - Einstein went in there and did it all... Not all, but almost all by deductive reasoning. That made a huge impression on Dirac, right? He realized that it was advanced mathematics was really important to understanding the way that nature works. - So, Dirac found a new hobby, obsessively updating classical equations with Einstein's theory of relativity, so that they would now work for relative physics scenarios as well that are those approaching the speed of light. He later said this was like a game for him, and so it's maybe not too much of a surprise then that he was one of the people trying to unite quantum physics and relativity because a theory that would cover both of these would be truly beautiful in his eyes. - Dirac didn't see the beauty in Klein, Gordon, and Fock's relativistic update of the Schrodinger equation, and he wasn't alone. Fellow physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, after reading Klein's paper, wrote him a letter, wishing his physics a speedy recovery. No text Pauli was known for being pretty savage. And actually, the Klein-Gordon equation is useful in some cases, but he and Dirac were both concerned with one particular feature of the equation. - And that's because the Klein-Gordon equation contains this term. That's a second-order time derivative. So the wave function is being differentiated twice with respect to time. Now, remember, the Schrodinger equation also contains a second-order derivative, but that's with space, not with time. Time is just first-order. So, why is this such a problem? Well, think of a very simple second-order time derivative. Something like d squared y over dt squared is equal to 3. Now, to figure out what y is, the function that satisfies this equation, we just have to integrate it twice. (pensive music) (record scratching) But notice, to find the solution, we now two integration constants, c and D. And the problem is that we can only find that if we know both y at a given time and if we know the first derivative of y at a given time. This makes sense physically, if you think about, say, throwing a ball in the air. If you want to predict the ball's future motion, well, then, you need to know where you threw it from, that's its position, and how hard you threw it, that's its velocity. Or in other words, you need to know both the position and the first derivative of the position. (suspenseful music) - Similarly, to predict a quantum systems future state using the Klein-Gordon equation, you'd need the initial wave function and the initial first derivative of the wave function. (suspenseful music) Now, the beauty of the Schrodinger equation was that if you knew only the wave function of a system at a given time, you could use it to determine all the future states of that system. But in the Klein-Gordon equation, the wave function no longer told the whole story. And this introduced a further problem. The probability of finding a particle in a given area could no longer be simply described by the modulus of the wave function, as it was for the Schrodinger equation. For the Klein-Gordon equation, a new equation was needed to describe the probability using the wave function, which takes a while to derive, so we won't get into that here, but it looks like this. And the problem with that equation is that unlike the simple modulus of the wave function, it can have negative solutions, negative probabilities. How can the chance of something happening be less than zero? As Dirac put it, that, of course, is physically nonsense. (suspenseful music) So, Dirac did what Dirac does best, and he set out to find his own solution that contained no second-order time derivatives. First, he rewrote the relativistic energy momentum relationship like this, which is a linear equation. So no squaring E, that is no squaring the energy operator, which is what gave rise to that second-order time derivative in the Klein-Gordon equation. Now, he just had to solve this equation and find the coefficients, alpha x, alpha y, alpha z, and beta, and he would have a solution. (pensive music) To do this, we can start by squaring both sides of the equation. Next, we can expand the momentum on the left-hand side into its three dimensions, and then expand the right-hand side to end up with this long equation. It might look pretty complicated, but there is a trick we can use. (pensive music) And notice that all these terms on the right-hand side are multiplied by pmc cubed, but on the left-hand side, there are no terms containing pmc cubed. So that tells us that when you multiply these coefficients together, like the alpha times beta and beta times alphas, all of that must be 0. And similarly, notice that these terms are multiplied by two different momenta, like px and py times c squared, which also don't have a counterpart on the left-hand side. So these alpha times alpha terms must also be equal to 0. And that just leaves this top row. These terms do match on both sides, which tells us that alpha x squared must be equal to 1, and so must alpha y squared, alpha z squared, and beta squared. So Dirac now had a set of simultaneous equations for alpha x, alpha y, alpha z, and beta that he just needed to solve. That sounds easy, right? But it's not that straightforward. - To see why, let's do some examples. So say alpha x is 1 and beta equals minus 1. Well, then, we get 1 squared, which is 1, equals minus 1 squared, which is also 1, so that satisfies the top equation. But if we fill it in here, we get 1 times minus 1, which is just minus 1, plus minus 1 times 1, which is, again, minus 1, for a total of minus 2. So, that doesn't work. So, let's try another number. Say alpha x is 1, and now it's alpha z that is minus 1. Well, in that case, we get 1 times minus 1. So, again, we get minus 1, plus minus, 1 times 1, again, minus 1. So we, again, get minus 2. And in fact, if you look at this top equation, the only numbers that satisfy this relation is 1 and minus 1. So all these coefficients have to be either 1 or minus 1, but if you fill that in, then the only two possible answers you're gonna get in these equations is minus 2 or positive 2. Now, the two equations that are giving problems are these two, and that's because alpha times beta is the same as beta times alpha. So, you're always gonna get minus 2 or 2. So, the only way to get out of this is to somehow make the order of multiplication matter. But where do you find something like that? (pensive music) - Let's think about a really simple vector, say 1 in the x-direction and 2 in the y-direction. If I reflect this vector along the line y equals x and then reflect it about the x-axis, I get this. But if I start again and instead reflect it first about the x-axis and then along y equals x, I get this, which is totally different. So, the order matters. How do we express this mathematically? We need some way to represent transformations, like reflections as a single coefficient, which means we need matrices. Matrices are arrays of numbers which encapsulate these transformations, telling us how to reflect, rotate, stretch, or squish across each dimension. Mathematically, the order we multiply them matters. Since we multiply the rows of the first matrix by the columns of the second, (pensive music) (graphic whooshing) A matrix that reflects along y equals x looks like this and a matrix that reflects about the x-axis looks like this. (pensive music) And if I apply them to that original vector one by one, you can see how we end up with different results. No text (pensive music) And actually, using matrices in quantum mechanics was not completely out there. Dirac had already seen it done by Werner Heisenberg, his new, if unlikely, friend. Dirac and Heisenberg were very different characters. Heisenberg was charming and outgoing, Dirac hated socializing and small talk. Once the two were on a cruise ship to a conference together and Heisenberg spent a lot of time dancing with women on board. So, Dirac asked him, \"Why do you dance?\" Heisenberg replied, \"When there are nice girls, it is a pleasure.\" Dirac thought about this for a bit before saying, \"How do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?\" So, they were pretty different guys, but Heisenberg had a profound impact on Dirac. (upbeat music) - Do you know what drew him to quantum mechanics initially? - He always said that Heisenberg gave him his start, he always said that. In later life, he used to begin lectures when he was 70, even 80 years old, with the following words. - Quantum mechanics was discovered by Heisenberg in 1925. - As a PhD student, Dirac had closely followed Heisenberg's work, and a few years earlier, Heisenberg had founded for certain properties, like position and momentum. The order of multiplication matters. So x times p is not the same as p times x. This was actually the beginning of Heisenberg's famous uncertainty principle, which says that there's a limit to how precisely we can know certain pairs of physical properties in quantum systems. It turns out that if the order of multiplication matters for two properties like position and momentum, then that means there's an inherent uncertainty in their combined measurements. The order we measure them in will change the outcome. Heisenberg's mentor, Max Born, suggested that he could represent this mathematically by using matrices, because there, the order of multiplication also matters. (pensive music) This led Heisenberg to a new form of quantum mechanics, which was mathematically equivalent to Schrodinger's equation, but it was based on matrix algebra. - Dirac recognized something similar in his coefficients where the order of multiplication clearly mattered. So, he thought matrices might be the solution. For his coefficients, he tried 2x2 matrices since they're the smallest, simplest matrices that could make the order of multiplication matter. He found that some worked with the equations. In fact, those reflection matrices we tried earlier worked well, but he just couldn't find solutions for all four coefficients that all worked together. - So this is not simple. Dirac is one of the smartest people of the 20th century in physics, right? But it was not easy. You don't have just to twiddle with bits of the Schrodinger equation. You'd have to do something completely radical. His working is in there, and you could see him really struggling. - Then, Dirac had a stroke of genius. He said, \"I suddenly realized that there was no need to stick to quantities, which can be represented by matrices with just two rows and columns. Why not go to four rows and columns?\" (compelling music) With these four 4x4 matrices, Dirac got these solutions to his simultaneous equations, a matrix with 1s on the diagonal is mathematically equivalent to a 1, and a whole array of 0s is the same thing as 0. So, all of the equations were satisfied. Dirac had found coefficients that worked. Now, we can substitute those matrices back into Dirac's linear equation, then rewrite the three momenta and alpha coefficients as vectors. And just as we did with the Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations, No text we can use the energy and momentum operators to make both sides act on the wave function. If we substitute those operators in, we get Dirac's final equation for the relativistic free electron. (compelling music) The young man who spent his life looking for mathematical beauty had found, perhaps, his most beautiful equation of all. - The people were expecting the solution to be horrible, and it turned out to be a thing of beauty, right? It was something you look at and you think, \"That is absolutely amazing.\" It's a pattern that Dirac found deep in nature. Nothing like that has been seen in physics at that time. (suspenseful music) - To see some of that beauty, you only have to compare it to the Schrodinger equation, which you can see right here. Now, the two look very similar, but there is a lot hidden in the Dirac equation. First of all, it's relativistic, so it works at really, really high speeds because it uses Einstein's energy momentum relationship, unlike the Schrodinger equation which breaks down there. But what's even more beautiful is that if you look at this, Dirac's equation isn't just first order in time derivatives, it's also first order in spatial derivatives. Whereas the Schrodinger equation was second order in spatial derivatives. So you might wonder, \"Well, why does that matter?\" Well, because not only does going first order in all derivatives solve the second-order time derivative problem of the Klein-Gordon equation, it now also treats time and space symmetrically. And it becomes really important if you start thinking about relativity, where time and space are not separate dimensions, they're intertwined in a four dimensional spacetime. And while the Schrodinger equation had just a single component wave function, to make the wave function work with these 4x4 matrices, in Dirac's case, you actually need a wave function that has four components. So, it'll look something like this. Psi one, psi two, psi three, and psi four. - The four-component wave function means that the Dirac equation describes four possible states for any quantum system, which reveals something Schr\u00f6dinger's single wave function didn't. An electron at a given energy level actually has two possible states due to different orientations of its intrinsic angular momentum, spin up and spin down. (pensive music) This spin creates a tiny magnetic field. So these two states are like tiny magnets pointing in opposite directions, and that has an interesting implication. Take hydrogen, which has one proton and one electron. Classically, the electron whizzes around the proton. But if you switch to the perspective of the electron, well, now, it's the proton that's moving. And since it's positively charged, that moving charge creates a magnetic field in the electron's frame of reference. So, now you've got this electron, which has its own mini magnetic field, interacting with a larger magnetic field, and that interaction will be slightly different for a spin up and a spin down electron. And as a result, some energy levels of the electron split into two closely-spaced energy levels. And you can actually see this if you zoom into the emission spectrum for a hydrogen atom. (suspenseful music) Schr\u00f6dinger's equation didn't predict that splitting since it just had one solution for each energy level. But with Dirac's four-component solution, the top two wave functions now described two different spin states with two slightly different energies. - Dirac admitted himself that he had never set out to capture spin in his equation. - I started out this work without any intention at all No text of bringing in the spin of the electron. - [Casper] But hold on, because if an electron at a given energy level only has two possible spin states, then why do we have a four-component wave function? Why are there four states and not just two? (compelling music) - [Derek] Well, that's what brings us back to that 1928 lecture at the start, the one that seemed to drive even the most well-established quantum physicists mad. Because that strange man presenting his work was actually Paul Dirac sharing his new equation with the world. It was Dirac's beautiful equation that Heisenberg called, \"The saddest chapter in modern physics.\" (somber music) - To understand why all those physicists were losing their minds, we only have to look at the simple case when a particle is at rest. This term right here describes the momentum. So, when the particle doesn't move, this becomes 0 and it drops out, which gives us this. Next, we can sub in the energy for this quantum operator to get this. So now, we know that beta times mc squared must be equal to the particle's energy. And if we write out beta and multiplied by mc squared, then we find two positive solutions and two negative solutions for the energy. So, negative energy solutions are baked right into the Dirac equation. (pensive music) This idea that a free electron could have negative energy was impossible for any of these physicists to accept. Because think about it. If electrons can have a negative energy, then that means that they could continually radiate positive energy, that is emit photons, and drop into lower and lower negative energy states. There would be no limit to how far they could fall into the negative energy abyss. (compelling music) - It looked like, to many very smart people, and Dirac was smart enough to know they had a point, that this equation, it got the mass and the magnetic moment of the electron. Yes, but on the other hand, it predicts this ridiculous situation, where you have negative energy values. - Right. - That's nonsense. So, Heisenberg said, \"I give up. This is just ridiculous.\" So, Dirac, he had, in some very clear sense, had to rescue his equation. (pensive music) - [Derek] Dirac spent three years sticking to his guns. He tried all sorts of ways to interpret his new equation No text to explain where the negative energy was coming from. Then, in 1931, he proposed something radical to explain the negative energy solutions. (suspenseful music) A new kind of particle unknown to experimental physics, having the same mass and opposite charge to an electron. We may call such a particle an anti-electron. We should not expect to find any of them in nature on account of their rapid rate of recombination with electrons. (suspenseful music) So, Dirac was proposing that those four states described in his four-component wave function are a spin up electron, a spin down electron, a spin up antielectron, and a spin down antielectron. - When Dirac said that, people didn't start running around saying, \"Where's this antielectron?\" They just ignored it. - Yeah. - Cut to the laboratory at Caltech. - In 1932, a Caltech postdoc named Carl Anderson was working on a project trying to identify the charge particles produced by cosmic rays. He photographed the tracks these particles left in a cloud chamber containing a uniform magnetic field. Anderson noticed several instances of a similar track. It looked a lot like the tracks he'd seen left by electrons. Only, it curved in the opposite direction in the magnetic field. Kind of like the tracks of positively charged protons. But there was no way it could be a proton based on the length of the track. It had traveled farther in air, and therefore it had to be much lighter. It had to be something with around the same mass as an electron, but opposite charge. A positive electron, or as he named it, a positron. He actually also tried to rebrand electrons as negatrons, but that one didn't quite stick. Just one year after Dirac proposed the antielectron, Carl Anderson found it entirely by accident. (uplifting music) - But this alone doesn't get rid of the negative energy problem. Remember what we said earlier. If any particles, like these positrons, can have negative energy, then they could continually radiate energy and drop into lower and lower negative energy states. Fortunately, Dirac proposed a solution to this problem as well, although it was a little crazy. (suspenseful music) - He theorized something called the Dirac sea, describing a vacuum as an infinite sea of electrons occupying all available negative energy states. And since no two electrons can occupy the same state, this prevents observable positive energy electrons from falling into the negative energy states. A hole or vacancy in this sea then becomes a positron. When an electron and a positron meet and annihilate, well, that's just an electron falling back into the sea and filling that hole. The theory is mathematically sound. Of course, it's Dirac we're talking about, but if you feel like it's hard to come to terms with the idea that we're floating on an infinite sea of electrons, well, you wouldn't be alone. - It's not even that crazy if, I don't know, several decades later, people find that exact model in a physical system. In condensed matter physics, you see an exact analogy of also having electrons in the conduction band and say valence-covalence band. - Yes, that's true. That's true. But Dirac really was, you know, out there. You see what I mean? Maybe it was people like... He doesn't see it, really seeing that people are saying, \"This is nonsense.\" But it was a way of Dirac's rectilinear thinking, No text thinking, \"Well maybe this is...\" And then it drove him to antimatter. - Thankfully, in 1941, a Swiss physicist named Ernst Stueckelberg had a clever idea. The way function contains a term that looks like this, where energy is multiplied by time. So, we can see that if we just change the sign of time when the energy is negative, then we get the same result because a negative multiplied by a negative gives us a positive. Stueckelberg took this, and he suggested that negative energy electrons traveling backwards in time are mathematically equivalent to positive energy antielectrons, that is positrons, traveling forwards in time. - A few years later, around 1948, Richard Feynman took this idea and used it in one of the most powerful tools in modern physics, the Feynman diagrams. In his sketches of particle interactions, he showed antiparticles traveling the opposite way to particles backwards in time. (pensive music) It was a brilliant trick. Negative energy solutions no longer had to mean there was negative energy or a Dirac sea. They simply indicated the presence of an antiparticle. (suspenseful music) We now know that there's a corresponding antiparticle for every subatomic particle, with the same mass, but opposite charge. So, the proton has the antiproton, the neutrino has the antineutrino, and so on. - According to his friend, Heisenberg, that was the biggest leap in 20th-century physics to say there's a whole slew of antiparticles No text corresponding to particles, and Dirac got that through this crazy model. (pensive music) - But all is not solved. This new antiworld introduces some big questions about the very nature of our universe. Because particles and their antiparticles are equal and opposite, when they come together, they annihilate and produce two photons with energy equivalent to their mass and kinetic energy. And this process is reversible. Two photons with the right energies can produce a matter and antimatter pair. This is called Breit-Wheeler pair production. (suspenseful music) (Big Bang exploding) During the first moments after the Big Bang, the universe was hot, dense, and full of these pairs popping into and out of existence. If an equal number of matter and antimatter particles were created, you would expect them to all annihilate each other in this dense environment, leaving behind only energy. But that didn't happen. We ended up with a universe full of matter. If we work backwards from how much matter and antimatter is in the universe today, it's actually estimated that only one particle per billion of matter needed to survive this hot, dense era and not get annihilated. That tiny difference would give us the makeup of our universe today, where matter dominates. - So what allowed that one particle per billion to escape annihilation? Why did matter win out over antimatter? (compelling music) Well, that's a pretty big question with some not so simple answers. So, we're doing an entire second video where we have some pretty spectacular stuff happening. We're getting into the beast. It's absolutely insane. I feel like I should not be in here. So you're making anti-atoms? - Yes. (energy humming) - [Casper] It's so cool. (compelling music) - Dirac is probably less well-known than people like Heisenberg or Schr\u00f6dinger, but his contribution to quantum physics was immense, and he was recognized for it. He shared the 1933 Nobel Prize with Schr\u00f6dinger for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory. And perhaps this gave strange, quiet Dirac some newfound confidence, because that physicist in the audience of his 1928 lecture at the start, Eugene Wigner, actually became a reasonable friend of Dirac's. And in 1934, introduced Dirac to his sister, Margit Wigner, a woman who would change Dirac's life, perhaps more than any equation or Nobel Prize. (pensive music) - They were antiparticles, right? They had completely different personalities. He had almost no empathy, right? And he knew it. She had buckets of it. He hardly talked, she couldn't stop talking. You could just go on, like they are completely different people. But the marriage did work. My great friend Lilia Harris Chandra, who knew them, she came out with a great line, great line, which is, \"He gave her status, she gave him a life.\" - So, I guess there is one particle-antiparticle pair that never annihilated.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: Citicorp Center skyscraper in New York City and the critical structural flaw"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the summer of 1978, it had been open for less than a year when its structuralengineer, Bill LeMessurier, made a terrifying discovery. His cutting edge skyscraper,an engineering marvel had a fatal flaw. Winds of just 110 kilometers per hour could cause it to collapsein the middle of Manhattan, potentially killing thousands. Over 200,000 people lived and worked in the surrounding area, and hurricane season was only weeks away. Here I am, the only manin the world who knew this. This thing is in real trouble. LeMessurierfaced a stark choice. He could stay silentand hope for the best, or he could try to fix it and risk professional ruin and mass panic. But Citicorp Center had a 100% probability of total collapse bythe end of the century. How could he save New Yorkfrom a near certain disaster? And how was this allowedin the first place? Veritasium producer andengineer, Henry van Dyck, traveled to New Yorkto investigate further. So in the 1960s, thefinancial giant, Citicorp, was trying to build a newheadquarters in Manhattan. So just down the street fromtheir original headquarters was this entire city block,which was up for sale. Well, everything except forthis church, Saint Peter's. So Citicorp came to thepastor, Ralph Peterson, and asked, \"What's it gonnatake for you guys to leave?\" And he came back andsaid, \"We're not leaving. Anything that Citicorp builds has to involve the church as part of it.\" What the pastor wanted was for the church to have its own separate identity. So eventually they agreed on two things. One was to replace thisold crumbling gothic church with a brand new one, whichyou see in front of you. And the second thing was that the church had to be physicallydistinct from the new tower. In other words, it had tobe completely independent. And again, most importantly,two thirds of the space above the church had to befree and clear, had to be open. Citicorp thenhired architect Hugh Stubbins to design the tower and the church and Bill LeMessurier asthe structural engineer, Stubbins explained theconstraints they faced. The church needed to bein the exact same spot and they needed to buildthe tower around it. If they were to maximize thefloor area, they would have to notch out one corner ofthe tower for the church. LeMessurier agreed that could work, but why not notch two, three,or even all four corners, essentially constructingthe skyscraper on stilts. So it's probably thefirst time in history that an engineer has cometo an architect and said, \"Let's make our job harder for us.\" The stilts wouldserve two main purposes. First, they would needto support at least half of the building's gravity load. The rest would be held upby a larger central column. Second, they would needto withstand the load due to high winds. But unlike an ordinary structure, the stilts wouldn't be at the corners. They would be at the center of each face. Imagine a chair, andinstead of the columns or the supports on eachcorner of the chair, it's at the midpoint of each side. Obviously, it's not an ideal situation. It doesn't seem very stable. Exactly. So it createdan engineering problem. As LeMessurierconsidered the problem, he suddenly had a flash of inspiration. He grabbed a napkin andsketched out an idea. He drew six layers of diagonal braces upeach face of the tower. These chevrons would transferthe forces to the middle of each face and down to the stilts. Now we have to see thegravity loads, right? But now here's the trick. The gravity loads arecoming down the column. When they get to the brace, they need to find theirway into the brace. Okay.So what you do is you take out that column right there. There is no way that load can jump over and go to that column. And now they're comingdown into the braces. They get down to the bottom here, and now they continue to go down. You take that column out, it has nowhere to goexcept into the brace. By removing the columns at the top and middle of each chevron, every tier acted as a separate unit. They were only connected to the braces and through the central core. So every eight stories,half of the gravity load would be forced through the chevrons to the midface columns,leading down to the stilts. Can you tell me how bigof a new idea was this? Yeah, well, this particularsystem was entirely unique, driven by the placement of the columns, driven by the conditions of the building. As satisfied the chevronscould transfer the gravity load, LeMessurier turned hisattention to the second problem, the wind. When wind hits the leftside of a normal building with corner columns, theentire frame deforms like this. So to reduce this deformation, we could strengthen thesejoints, but there's a better way because beams and columns aremuch stronger in compression or tension than theyare with bending loads. So if we add diagonal bracing, they can carry this horizontal load. The beams sort of act like springs, and when they're compressed,they push on the joints. When they're stretched, they pull inwards. With braces like these, the wind load compresses this diagonal and stretches this one. The left column pulls down in tension and the right columnpushes up in compression. Where the braces meet, they both push thebottom beam to the right. This stretches the left sideand compresses the right one. But this floor is thetop of the next chevron, so this lower sectionis carrying the force from the layer above it and the normal wind load from the side. And this keeps happening at every chevron so the wind load builds upas you go down the building. But Citicorp can't havecorner columns like this because of the gravity load. So in the wind, this entire triangle wants to rotate like this and to prevent that from happening, this chevron pulls down going into tension and the far chevronpushes up in compression. The top and bottom beams are again forced intocompression and tension. The wind load ends up wrappingaround the entire building. So every chevron worksto transfer the wind load to the section below. When we think about skyscrapers, like how big of a deal is wind? If we made a skyscraper here, you know, out of all these differentthings, you push with your phone, you get a certain amount of force, but then you push on my phone as well with a certain amount of force, but your phone is alsopushing on my phone. And so that's the shear in the building, what we call the building shear. It increases as you go down the building. You know, at the 10th floor, you may have a smaller forcethan at the 60th floor, but the total force of the 10th floor is like carrying everything above it. So it's much bigger than what'sgoing on on the 60th floor. So these chevrons were key to LeMessurier's design, but the braces were massive, almost 40 meters long end to end. So even if you could fabricatea steel brace that long, there would be no way toget it through Manhattan. So instead it was sent in pieces to be welded together on site. The chevron bracing solved thewind and gravity load issues, but it also created a different problem. Because of the chevron bracing system, they were able to save alot of money and weight. It was a lighter constructthan most other buildings in New York, I think it was22 pounds a square foot, which is very light. Unfortunately, that madethe building swayable, it could move in the wind. That wasn't necessarily astructural problem, it was just, it could have beenuncomfortable for the patrons. The way they could solve this was just let's add more structural steeland make it a lot stiffer. But the solution thatLeMessurier came up with was far more elegant. He adopted something thathad been regularly used in bridges, power lines and ships, but never before in a building:a tuned mass damper or TMD. So we're here at Stark Laboratories, and I'm not with Iron Man, but instead the Columbia Space Initiative, the student team here oncampus who has helped us build this incredible tuned massdamper kind of system. We'll use this cart torepresent a building. By pulling it back and releasing it, we can excite its resonant frequency, And then we'll put on alittle pendulum, aluminum rod, and a mass at the bottom. As the building sways, it transfers some of itskinetic energy to the pendulum, which starts to swing. Then some of its energy isdissipated through friction at the hinge. The pendulum and the building oscillate out of phase from each other. So every time the buildingpulls the pendulum in a different direction,more energy is lost, significantly dampingthe sway of the tower. But this system needsto be carefully tuned so it has the same frequencyas the building itself and the right amount of friction. So first, the mass needsto be at least one to 5% of the building's weight to be effective. And we tune the frequency of the TMD by adjusting the length of the pendulum. I assume engineers domath around this thing, but we're just doing it by feel. (both laugh) Second, by looseningor tightening the bolt, we can tune the amount of damping. We need to dissipate more energyfrom friction at the hinge to stop the swaying faster. We just tighten the top bolt, make the whole system a little bit, you know, add a littlebit more resistance, and we'll see if we candampen it now further. Woohoo.Much different. Yeah. Yeah, that lookedgreat. That was so quick. Yeah, that was. It is cool when an experiment works. Does not always happen. There are manydifferent types of TMDs, like pendulums, liquid columns,and a large mass on springs. LeMessurier used thislast one in Citicorp. What you seeis a mass of concrete, which is 29 feet squareand about eight feet thick and weighs 400 tons. It was installed on the top floor and it's affectionately knownas that great block of cheese. As Citicorp sways to one side, the block starts to movein the same direction. Some energy is dissipatedthrough separate viscous dampers. Citicorp's oscillations are damped through those energy lossesas the block oscillates out of phase to the building's motion. LeMessurier expected thedamper to reduce the amplitude of swaying by roughly 50%, and he saved around $4 million by not needing an additional2,800 tons of structural steel. With both the chevron bracing to channel forces to the stilts and the tuned mass damper to reduce sway, LeMessurier was convinced the building was structurally sound. On Citicorp Center's opening day in 1977, it was the 11th tallestbuilding in the world. It was described by the press as an acrobatic act of architecture. Later, the AmericanInstitute of Architects even gave it an honor award,calling it a tour de force as a stylish silhouette in the skyline, and, for the pedestrian, ahovering cantilevered hulk. So then, it's goingswimmingly for years, right? Well, it's goingswimmingly for about a year. The first hint oftrouble came in May, 1978. LeMessurier was talkingwith another client about welding similar chevron braces. The architect and thesteel fabricator said, \"Tell me, how did thosewelded braces work out?\" Seems like overkill, they thought. And LeMessurier says,\"Yeah, they were fine. Let me call my guys inNew York and I'll check.\" So he put the call intohis office in New York and they say, \"Oh, Bill, didn't you know? We bolted those connections.\" The contractorhad suggested saving a quarter of a milliondollars by using bolts to attach the braces instead of welds. And LeMessurier's firm had agreed. There is nothing thatsays a bolt is inherently worse or better than a weld. You use them in different circumstances for different reasons, but it's a little surprising to find out, I thought the connectionsin this tour de force, one of a kind skyscraper, you know, that's on the cutting edgeof structural engineering, was connected one way, but apparently it's connected another way. But if the braces are going like this, where are they gonna go? You know, you only need the weld when the braces are going like this. Since the gravity load was always compressing thebraces, some of the chevrons only went into tensionunder very high winds. And even then, it wasn't a lot of tension. LeMessurier trusted that his team did the right calculations,and the substitution was fine, logical, even. (phone ringing) But around a month later, LeMessurier got a phonecall from a student who wanted to ask some questionsabout the Citicorp Center. And his teacher said to him, \"That engineer didn't know what he's doing and nobody should put thecolumns in the middle. They should put 'em in thecorners. That's silly.\" And I told the student, I said, \"Well, you're a professor's full of it. He doesn't understand theproblem we had to solve.\" LeMessurier wentthrough the calculations with the student to reassure him the stiltswere in the right place. But the interesting thingis, is in that moment, he's thinking about windloads from all directions. You know, late spring,early summer of 1978, Bill LeMessurier is workingon the back of a Hilton Hotel that, in plan, forms atriangle, not a rectangle. Now you got a triangle. What'syour orthogonal direction? You just have to give up and say, \"We're gonna analyze itfrom every direction.\" That's going on the momentthat Bill LeMessurier gets this phone call. Then I called him backand pointed it out to him that there's some peculiarthings about this building. The worst loading casewas not the diagonal, but it was the ordinary windthat everybody thinks about. The wind pushes straight on the building. That was the critical case. He said, you know what, I've been getting all thesecalls from all these people. I'm gonna sit down and explain this thing. He decided to double check what happens to thebuilding if wind is hitting a corner of the building, notstraight on one of the faces. These are also known as quartering winds. So he split the wind intoits perpendicular components. So the west side and northside are hit by the force divided by the square root of two. He computed the forces foreach, as we did before, and summed up the result, but then he noticed something strange. Then now welook at the diagonals, the stresses in half of them vanish, and in the other half, double. Since the force on each side was F over the square root of two, these beams get double that. Compared to LeMessurier calculations for the perpendicular wind load, the forces here were 40% higher. So 1.4 by itself is notenough to wreck havoc. Okay? It may be, but it may not be. Okay.So then the question is, well, what happens? This increase inforces wouldn't have mattered in the original design since the chevrons werefully welded together. But that wasn't the case anymore. LeMessurier rememberedhis earlier phone call. The welds holding the chevrons together were swapped for bolts. How did his team calculatethe number of bolts per joint? Did they consider quartering winds? It would be a miracle ifthey ever thought that through, to think about the diagonal wind. It just wasn't in the nature of anybody. So I had a bit of a worry. I didn't panic right away, but I decided to go downto New York to my office. LeMessurierrequested the building diagrams and poured over all of the connections. He looked at how his firmcalculated the number of bolts. There was no question, theyhad taken straight on wind, not the diagonal wind. Although wind speed is highest at the top of the tower, the wind shear builds up as you go lower. Looking at this brace aroundhalfway down the tower, the perpendicular wind load is 454 tons. Because of the skipped columns, all of these braces carrythe same gravity load, just 340 tons, from theeight stories above. The gravity load buildsup in the center column, not in the braces, which means there are 114tons of tension in this brace. If each bolt can withstand around 28 tons, that would require four bolts. The original calculations saidjust four bolts were enough. So that was all they used. But when he added quartering winds, LeMessurier's calculationsshowed there were some braces that needed far more bolts. At this particular part of the building, which I can show you on mycalculations is right about here, and Bill LeMessurier talkedabout the 30th floor, and I always wondered whywas it the 30th floor? The 40% increasefrom quartering winds means that this brace hasa wind load of 635 tons. The tension in the brace is now 295 tons, over double the original calculation. So these braces actually needaround 10 bolts, not four. But then it turned outthey had done something else. LeMessurier'sfirm considered the braces to be minor structural elements. They didn't use the right factor of safety to calculate the number of bolts. They should have overestimatedthe tension in the brace by underestimating the gravity load. With only 75% of the gravity load, the tension in the beam is now 380 tons. So they really needed 14bolts, but they used only four. I thought thisthing is in real trouble. Imagine, you know, what Bill LeMessurier wasthinking at that moment. You see that number and you're like, \"Oh my God, this is serious.It's really serious.\" LeMessurierwas starting to panic. He didn't wanna rush to conclusions, so he flew to Canada tocheck his calculations with Alan Davenport at theBoundary Layer Wind Tunnel. After running more tests, they found that it was evenworse than LeMessurier thought. The estimated 40% increase in stress was technically correct, but LeMessurier made his calculations assuming the building wasn't moving. This is called static conditions. But the wind tunnel gaveLeMessurier a dynamic analysis, how the forces change whenthe building is moving around. To LeMessurier's horror,the wind tunnel analysis showed that the stresses could increase up to 60% more thanoriginally anticipated. LeMessurier squirreledhimself away in Maine and worked through the datafrom the wind tunnel again, joint by joint on every floor. The weakest joints were atthe building's 30th floor. If those failed, theentire building would fall. But what were the chancesthat a storm strong enough to topple the building wouldpass through New York City? LeMessurier dug through thehistorical weather reports. On average, a storm strongenough to tear the building apart occurred every 67 years. But only if the tunedmass damper was working. If a storm knocked out power, then even 110 kilometer per hour winds blowing for just five minuteswould collapse the building. In any given year, the chance of a storm thatsize happening was one in 16. Just one year beforeCiticorp was completed, wind gusts of 110 kilometers per hour roared through New York City as Hurricane Belle passed through. What do you think this momentwas like for LeMessurier, when he ran these calculations, like- Oh, it must have been devastating. I mean, it just must havebeen, I can't imagine the fear. I can't imagine the feelings. I mean, like, it just must have been truly a moment he never thoughthe would live through. That storm was gonnafall down in my lifetime. And since this was July, it could fall down the summer of 1978. LeMessurier needed todecide and decide fast. But revealing this mistakecould mean lawsuits, bankruptcy and professional ruin. He could stay silent, only Davenport knew and hewouldn't reveal anything, or he could entirely disappear. In a later interview headmitted, \"I did say to myself, I could drive down the Maine Turnpike at a hundred miles an hour and deliberately driveinto a bridge abutment. That would be the end andall of this would go away. I thought about that.\" But there was a 1 in 16 chanceof collapse that very fall. With thousands of lives at risk, there was never anyother choice but to act. After speaking to a few lawyers and other engineering experts, LeMessurier told the architect,Stubbins, and together they informed Citicorp'schairman, Walter Wriston. Within hours of that meeting, LeMessurier acquired emergency generators for the tuned mass damper. The TMD was originallydesigned to stabilize any swaying for comfort,but now it became the crutch that the tower leaned on. LeMessurier pinned all his hopes on it. He called the confidentialrepair plan Project Pandora, but that sounded ominous, so he came up with theSpecial Engineering Review of Events Nobody Envisioned,or Project Serene for short. Each night, welderswould enter the building after everyone left,rip off the sheet rock around the chevron beams, and then weld two five-centimeter thick, two-meter long steel plates on each joint. Like Band-Aids, literally Band-Aids, on both sides of these joints. After, they'd replaced the wall and clean everything upbefore the office workers came back the next morning, They needed to weld over 200 joints and LeMessurier ranked them by importance, starting with the ones on the 30th floor. But the repairs wouldn't be completed before hurricane season. So Citicorp worked with the Red Cross to develop a 10 block evacuation plan. Like, how many peoplewere at risk in the building and if it fell, would itaffect other buildings? Like, were there chances of it leading to something more disastrous? Absolutely, this would have toppled and it would've toppledinto another building, which would've toppledinto another building, which would've continueda horrific process. So it was untold what theultimate effects could have been. I mean, like,just the evacuation plans were how many people? Thousands, the buildingitself housed thousands and then the residents and the businesses surrounding the building,it was into the thousands. Despite the risk, they decided not to tell the public or even the officeworkers in the building. No one wanted a mass panic. Instead, they fitted strain gauges on important structural members. The gauges monitored theskyscrapers every bend and twist from a comm center eight blocks away. At least that would givethem a little bit of warning. But this plan required new telephone lines, and the phone company wouldn't get around to doing this for months. So Citicorp's chairman immediately called AT&T's president and the lines wereinstalled the next morning. Now you might not be able to install emergency telephone lines at a whim, but you can still stayconnected no matter what. (phone ringing) It's probably not that important. Henry, can you hear me?

(phone ringing) (sighs) I mean, should probably take this. (phone beeps) But even though LeMessurier tried to keep Project Serene under wraps, people started asking questions. On August 8th, Citicorpreleased a statement about the repairs. Now, we had to cook up aline of bull, I'll tell you. And white lies at thispoint are entirely moral. (class laughs)You don't wanna spread terror in the community to people thatdon't need to be terrorized. We were terrorized, noquestion about that. Severalnewspapers reported on it, but they didn't have the details. Then LeMessurier got a message. The New York Timeswas trying to reach him. If he didn't respond, theywould know something was up. So I mixed a martini for myself and it's one minute past six. I dialed The New York Times. I pick it up the phone,they pick up the phone, it's a tape recorder saying, The New York Times has goneon strike as of six o'clock. (class laughs) Not only did The NewYork Times go on strike, but all the newspapers inNew York went on strike until October. So we had a press blackout and that was the greatestthing that ever happened. (class laughs) The press was off their back and the weather was beautiful. The repair work continued smoothly. But late August brought thenews everyone had been dreading. Hurricane Ella startsbrewing in the Caribbean. And this is the one stormthat they're nervous about. The repairswere halfway done by now. I think it was a one in 200 year storm that it could withstand, but LeMessurier wasn't taking chances 'cause he didn't know theintensity of the storm. And this was a strong storm. So there was, there was a chance. There was absolutely a chance and they had to prepare for that chance. By Friday, September 1st, Ella was making her way toward New York, with winds reaching 200kilometers per hour. City officials bracedto start the evacuation. Police would go door todoor to get everyone out within a 10 block radius. For 24 tense hours, Ellastalled around North Carolina. Like LeMessurier said,we were sweating blood. But sometime in the night, Hurricane Ella veered off intothe sea at the last minute. It intensified and hit Canada with peak winds of 225kilometers per hour. But Citicorp was safe. LeMessurier described thatnext morning in New York as the most beautiful daythat the world's ever seen. They completed the repairs in October, just six weeks afterLeMessurier told Citicorp. Now the building,according to LeMessurier, can withstand a one in 1000 storm. The repairs costbetween $4 and $5 million, but LeMessurier arguedthat Citicorp approved an earlier building designthat cost $5 to $6 million more, so they were willing to spend that much on the skyscraper anyway. And for almost two decades, the secret was confinedto a small inner circle. But in 1995, \"The New Yorker\" finally brought ProjectSerene into the light. Far from being vilified, LeMessurier was praised for owning up to his mistake and fixing the issue as soon as possible. After the article, NewYork updated the building code to require quartering wind calculations. And since thatfirst damper in Citicorp, TMDs have spread across the globe. allowing architects to pushskyscrapers taller and slimmer. It's in the first tallbuilding in the world ever built with mechanical helpto make the structure work. That's remarkable. Incidentally, that has been now copied a hundred times in Japan,this is ubiquitous, and when I go to Japan,I'm treated like a tin god 'cause I'm the father ofthe tuned mass damper. I said, \"Really?\" Of the 20 tallestbuildings in the world, six include the tuned mass damper, and they're especially critical in typhoon or earthquake-prone regions. For example, Taipei 101 hasa massive 660 ton pendulum that stabilizes the building. It can withstand up to 200kilometer per hour winds and earthquakes with magnitudes over 6.8. But the legacy of this building is still steeped in controversy. First, who was the mysteriousstudent that started it all? I think it was spring of 1978. There's a student at Princeton,an undergraduate student by the name of Diane Hartley, and she's studying structural engineering. It was time for her toconsider a senior thesis, and then they decided that a study of the new CiticorpTower would be wonderful. It's a remarkable thesis. It contains a lot of theoriginal engineering calculations by the engineers. She's looking through the documentation, where did they consider quartering winds? And she's not seeing it\"I must be wrong,\" she says. She's just an undergraduate student and you guys are award-winningstructural engineers. The engineer explains to Diane Hartley, quartering winds are nota factor in this building. So she's satisfied. Shegraduates, that's it. Doesn't think about it again. But a year after \"TheNew Yorker\" article, the BBC released adocumentary on the crisis. And so she, she was holding her baby and she turned on thetelevision, and lo and behold, she heard them reference aconversation with a student, an engineering student from New Jersey reaching out to LeMessurier. And she said, \"I almostdropped my baby.\" And then so she just assumedfor years afterwards, she assumed that it wasn't me because I didn't speak to LeMessurier. But then in 2003,her thesis advisor told Diane that he checked all theother New Jersey engineering and architecture programs, and no one else was working on a projectabout Citicorp in 1978. She was the only one. She never spoke toLeMessurier personally. She never claimed to speakto LeMessurier personally. The assumption was that eitherLeMessurier was mistaken and that it was DianeHartley who made the call, it was a female, or more likely that LeMessurier was basically tipped off by his New York engineers. Then, in 2011, a man named Lee DeCarolis came forward. And the phone call, as we understand it, came from a student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. His name is Lee DeCarolis. He's not asking for money, he's not asking for fame or glory. He's just saying, \"This is interesting. And I'm the guy who made this call.\" And he said, \"Yeah, I had a conversationwith Bill LeMessurier.\" And he pretty much lined up with what LeMessurier himself said. Sadly, LeMessurierpassed away in 2007 before he could confirmthe student's identity. Believe it or not, 40years later, there's still, I learned, a lot of rawfeeling still on this. People aren't anxious to talk about this, especially people thatwere involved in it, even people that weren't involved in it but were tangentially involved in it. We reached out to aLeMessurier Associates and they refused torespond to our request. You think that the namesakefor their company stood up and did the right thing, but I don't think they wannabe associated with mistakes. Their projectdescription for Citicorp doesn't even mention the repairs. The building was sold toBoston Properties in 2001, who renamed it 601 Lexington. They also didn't respondto our request for comment and refused to let usfilm inside the building. Further questions arosein 2021, with a new study from the National Instituteof Standards and Technology. They wanted to see if quarteringwinds were more demanding for a building like Citicorp, Although they did conclude that the pressure fromperpendicular winds was greater, their analysis didn't includeany internal structure specific to Citicorp. As for LeMessurier,the engineering field still regards his actions as upstanding. And the Citicorp case istaught all over the world as a case of good engineering ethics. In fact, in my ownengineering ethics course, I learned about the Citicorp building. And every structuralengineer experiences this. When you actually feel theweight of the responsibility, you're saying, \"Based on my engineering, that building is gonna stand up.\" Nobody else worries about it. And so if you think aboutthe emotional pressure that Bill LeMessurier was under and then needing to come backand do something about it and to mobilize and to holdthat during this entire process, it's truly a remarkable story. I mean, I can't imagineit. I can't imagine it. I said, look, if you gota license from the state and a certification from university first, then now you're gonna use that license to hold yourself out as a professional, you have a responsibility beyond yourself. If you see somethingthat is a social risk, good heavens, this thingwould kill thousands, you must do something,you must do something."}]}

What's gonna happen to that rock? Well, you would thinkthat it would continue with constant velocity in a straight line. That's just Newton's first law. But what actually happensis it eventually slows down and stops. So why does this happen? Where did all the rock's energy go? (pensive orchestral music) At the turn of the 20th century, the problem of energy conservation baffled some of the greatest minds, including Albert Einstein. Einstein came up with a possible solution, but then a little-knownunpaid mathematician named Emmy Noether proved he was wrong. And in doing so, she created a whole newparadigm for physics, one that underlies all of particle physics and explains why anything is conserved. (gentle inquisitive music) It all started in 1915 atthe University of Gottingen, where Einstein was giving six lectures on his new theory of gravity. What would become thegeneral theory of relativity. The lectures were well received, but Einstein hadn't yetsettled on the final form of the field equations. One problem he was facing was how to show thattotal energy was conserved in his new theory. And this is the wholebeginning of this story, right? Classically, they thoughtthey had this understanding of what the energy of thegravitational field was. All of a sudden with these new equations, they go, \"Where is it? You know, is it in the curvature? You know, is it in thestress-energy tensor? Where's the term that we're looking for?\" [Derek] Einsteinsuggested that the principle of conservation of energy, long established as a bedrock of physics, might hold the key to working out the correct field equations. In the audience, legendary mathematician David Hilbert was intrigued. So he started to look for theenergy conservation equations in Einstein's new theory,but the best he could find was a set of equations knownas the Bianchi identities. They showed that energy was conserved, but only in a completely empty universe. So for one like ours filledwith stuff, they seemed useless. Hilbert was stumped. Fortunately, he knew justthe person for the job. His new assistant, Emmy Noether. (light thoughtful music) [Derek] From an earlyage, Noether had dreamed of following the footsteps of her father, a mathematics professor atthe University of Erlangen. She got special permission to attend lectures at the university, but they refused to admither as an official student. The Erlangen Academic Senate held that the admission of women \"would overthrow all academic order.\" (lively orchestral music) So in 1903, she spent asemester at Gottingen instead. There she learned about anew way to approach geometry using symmetry. (gentle thoughtful music) Symmetry is one of thoseideas that's easy to recognize but harder to describe. If I align a mirror onthis triangle like so, then it looks the sameas without the mirror, and that's because thisis an axis of symmetry. The reflections about this axis leave the triangle unchanged. And the same thing happensif I put the mirror like this or if I orient the mirror like this. So this triangle hasthree axes of symmetry. Now, mathematicians generalizethe idea of symmetry further to be any action you can take that leaves an object unchanged. So something else I could dois I could rotate this triangle by 120 degrees or by 240 degrees or by 360 degrees. Together, these six actions capture all the symmetriesof the equilateral triangle. [Derek] But you can alsohave more abstract symmetries, for example, with a mathematical function. If I shift this function up ordown by some constant amount, call it a, then all ofits y values will change. But if I differentiate thatfunction, I get the slope, and that remains unchanged regardless of whatever constant is added. So you can add anyconstant to this function, and its derivative always stays the same. So there is a kind oftranslation symmetry. And unlike the symmetries of the triangle, this is a continuous symmetry, meaning you can shift itby any amount you like. Over the next 12 years, Noether became a leadingexpert on symmetry. She became only thesecond woman in Germany to earn a PhD in mathematics, and she used thisexpertise to help Hilbert and Einstein with theirproblem of energy conservation. The issue had bothered Einstein so much that he proposed a newconservation equation. It said that if we addtogether the energy of matter and the energy of the gravitational field, then that total remains constant. Its change over time and space is zero. But when Noether saw this, she was convinced Einsteinhad made a fundamental mistake because this equation disregardsthe foundational principle that general relativity is built on. (light pensive music) 10 years earlier, in 1905, Einstein had introduced hisspecial theory of relativity, and it was built on the ideathat the laws of physics were independent ofyour frame of reference. But so far Einstein hadonly applied this principle to inertial frames of reference. Those are frames thatmove at a constant speed. He began wondering what would it take to generalize that, to consider more general states of motion. After all, trains on theplatform; he loved trains. Trains would speed up or slow down. People, you know, moving around the world don't only move at a singleconstant speed forever. In 1907, he wrote, \"Is it conceivable thatthe principle of relativity also applies to systemsthat are accelerated relative to each other?\" This made him wonder; perhaps his principle couldalso be applied to accelerating and rotating frames, framesthat move in any way in general. That's the \"general\"in general relativity. So Einstein got to work on this largely intellectual pursuit. But then, as he wasdaydreaming in the patent office, he had what he called thehappiest thought of his life. [Derek] He imagined the window cleaner at the top of the oppositebuilding falling off. (window cleaner screams) And Einstein realized thatwhile the man was falling, he wouldn't feel his own weight. He would be weightless, and anything he dropped on his way down would remain stationary relative to him. It would be just as if hewas floating in outer space. It's ironic, we would've said, \"Oh, he's being pulled down to the ground because the gravity of theEarth is exerting a force. But Einstein said, whilethat person is in motion, what we call free fall motion, they would actuallyfeel no gravity at all. There must be some equivalencebetween accelerated motion and the action of gravity. So Einstein arrived at what he called theequivalence principle. [Derek] If you were stuckin a rocket in outer space accelerating at 9.8meters per second squared, then it would be the exact same as if you were standingon the surface of Earth. And this was huge because it meant that ifEinstein could figure out how to understand accelerating frames, then he didn't just geta more general theory; he would also have anew theory of gravity. But to achieve this, Einstein needed to makesure the laws of gravity had the same form inevery frame of reference. (train whooshing) This is the idea of general covariance, and it's one of the coretenets of general relativity. To satisfy it, Einstein knew he had to use special mathematicalobjects called tensors. A simple kind of tensor is a vector. You can write a vectoras a set of components multiplied by their basis vectors. For example, this vector can be written as 3x hat plus 2y hat. But I can also write this using a different coordinate system. And with these new basis vectors, the original vector isnow written as 2a plus 1b. So the components, thenumbers in this list, changed, but the vector didn't. It stayed the same. And that's because whenthe basis vectors change, the components adjustin a complementary way to keep the vector the same. The vector itself is independent of which coordinate system you use. And the same is true for tensors, only now instead of havingjust two components, a general tensor canhave any number of them in the form of a matrix. And just like with vectors,you can change a tensor from one coordinate system to another, and the tensor stays the same. So that's why Einstein had to use them to build his new theory. And that was exactly theproblem that Noether found because when she looked at Einstein's proposedenergy conservation equation, it contained a pseudotensor. And as the name implies,that isn't quite a tensor. When you try to transform it from one frame of reference to another, it doesn't remain the samequantity in different frames. The gravitational energy youmight observe in one frame completely disappears in another. And Einstein, you know, he had some strange thoughts about this. I mean, people were trying tostamp conservation of energy into relativity by bending the rules of mathematics. So, Noether knew thatEinstein's proposed solution couldn't be the answer,and that made her think, \"What if general covariance and energy conservationare simply incompatible? And if that's the case, then why?\" General covariance saysthat laws of physics must stay the same when youchange reference frames. So that is a kind of symmetry, exactly what Noether hadspent her career studying. So she started thinking about the symmetries of the universe, beginning with the simplest possible case, an empty static universe. (light contemplative music) Imagine you are anastronaut in this universe. Since it's empty, there is nothing special about any particular point. I mean, it doesn't matter ifyou're over here or over there; the universe is completely symmetric under translations in space. So suppose you throw a ball; well, it'll travel at a given speed, and after a short amount of time, it will have traveled some distance. But since the laws ofphysics are the same here as just before, we canshift the whole universe, and we're back to thesituation we started with. And we can keep doing this over and over, and this shows us thatthe object will continue with that same speed indefinitely. So what we've discovered is that the principle ofconservation of momentum is a direct result of the fact that there'sa translation symmetry in the universe, that anexperiment done in one spot will give identical results to that same experimentdone somewhere else. You could move everythingfrom one place to another, and the physics won't change. Similarly, the laws ofphysics don't depend on whether you performan experiment like this or rotate everything by 90 degrees. This universe issymmetric under rotations. So imagine we take ametal rod and spin it. If we let it rotate for a minute, then it will have movedthrough a small angle, but we can rotate the whole universe back by that same angle and now we're at thestarting position again. And we can keep doing this so that each instantlooks exactly the same as the one before, which means the object will keep rotating this way indefinitely. So the law of conservationof angular momentum comes from the rotationalsymmetry of the universe. Now, another importantsymmetry of this universe is time symmetry. The laws of physicsdon't change over time; if you do an experiment today or tomorrow, you will get the same result. So what does this symmetry lead to? Well, to understand this,we're gonna dig into some math and a different way of doing mechanics using the principle of least action. Previously on Veritasium, we learned that everythingalways follows the path that minimizes a quantityknown as the action. This is equivalent to the integral of the Lagrangian L over time. In the simplest case, that's just the kineticminus potential energy. Euler and Lagrange found that the principle ofleast action is obeyed, so long as this set of differentialequations is satisfied. So Noether used action to see how physics was affected by different symmetries. So suppose we do an experiment where the result is the same now as some tiny time interval epsilon later, then how does this affect the action? Well, the time is goingto change from just t to t plus epsilon, and as a result, the Lagrangianis also going to change. So the new Lagrangian will be L prime, which is equal to the old Lagrangian, plus how much the Lagrangianchanges over time, that's just dL by dt, multiplied by how long that change lasts, so multiplied by epsilon. But now also remember that the result is gonna be the exact samenow as a little while later, which means that whatever this term is, the dL over dt, doesn't affectthe equations of motion, and it's from this symmetry in the action that we're gonna be able tofind the conserved quantity. So let's take dL/dt and rewriteit using the chain rule. That gives us the partialderivative of L with respect to X times dx over dt, plus the partial derivativeof L with respect to v times dv over dt. But we can sub in thepartial derivative of L with respect to x with this term from theEuler-Lagrange equation. And we can simplify this further by writing dx over dt as v, and that gives us this expression. And now notice what we've got right here. We've got the time derivativeof some function, dL over dv, times another function,plus that first function times the time derivativeof the second function. So we can use the reverseof the product rule to simplify this to the timederivative of dL over dv times v. Then as a final step, we canbring dL over dt to the right. So what we found is that if you take the timederivative of this quantity, it's equal to zero, which means that whateverthis is has to be a constant. So what is it? Well, remember that in thesimplest case, the Lagrangian is just equal to the kineticminus potential energy, which we can write as1/2 mv squared minus v. So if we take the partialderivative of the Lagrangian with respect to v, we'rejust gonna get d over dt, m times v multiplied by v, so this is gonna become mv squared. And then we can sub in the Lagrangian. So this becomes minus1/2 mv squared minus v, but also minus here. So this becomes plus v, andall of that's equal to zero, which we can simplifyto just 1/2 mv squared plus v is equal to zero. But wait a second becausethis is just the total energy. So what we've discovered isthat time translation symmetry is equivalent to sayingthat energy is conserved. (dramatic orchestral music) The principle of conservation of energy is a direct consequence oftime translation symmetry. In a theorem, Noether proved that all of these examplesare no coincidence. For centuries, people had no idea where conservation laws came from. But now Noether had discoveredthe origin of all of them. She proved that anytime youhave a continuous symmetry, you get a corresponding conservation law. Translational symmetry givesyou conservation of momentum, rotational symmetry gives you conservation of angular momentum, and time translation symmetry gives you conservation of energy. But these are all symmetriesof a static empty universe. The universe we live in is very different. In the 1920s, astronomersmeasured the velocities of distant galaxies, and they realized all ofthem are moving away from us. The farther away they are,the faster they're moving. The implication was clear. In the distant past, everything must have beenmuch closer together. In the 1990s, precisemeasurements of supernovae revealed that not only wasthe universe expanding, but that expansion was speeding up. This means over large timescales, our universe is not symmetric in time. It was very different13 billion years ago, and it'll be differentbillions of years from now. Since we don't have time symmetry, that also means energy,as we usually think of it, isn't conserved. There's no reason forenergy to be conserved anymore 'cause you don't have that symmetry. [Derek] Think about aphoton of visible light emitted 380,000 years after the Big Bang, it travels through the universe unimpeded to arrive at our telescopes, not as visible light but as a microwave. It has lost 99.9% of its energy. Where did the energy go? Doesn't go anywhere. Energy's not conserved. [Derek] And this is exactly what's happening to the rock as well. It starts off with energy, but as it travels throughthe expanding universe, it slows down and stops. (gentle thoughtful music) The energy doesn't really goanywhere; it just disappears. It ends up coming to rest with regard to the otherparticles in the universe. This doesn't violate any laws of physics because energy andmomentum aren't conserved if there is no time or spatial symmetry. So once you know that symmetries give you conservation laws, and so once those symmetries are gone, you don't have to worry about those conservation laws anymore, then you can start dropping these concepts of trying to force something that you want to say isfundamental into the theory, and you just deal withwhat the theory gives you. But if energy isn'tconserved in our universe, then why does it usually seem like it is? (light mysterious music) That's because when you'relooking at the short timescales that we're used to, time translation symmetrypretty much holds; an experiment done todaywill give the same results as the same experiment done tomorrow. So that means for allintents and purposes, energy is conserved. But over large timescales onthe order of millions of years, well, then the expansion of theuniverse can't be neglected, and the symmetry is broken. So only when you lookat timescales that big do you notice that energy isn't conserved. Noether's first theoremexplains why a rock or a photon loses energy, but it didn't fully solve the problem of energy conservationin general relativity. See, so far, Noether had onlydealt with an empty universe where you could shift the whole universe and the laws of physicswould stay the same. But this doesn't workin general relativity, where the curvature can changefrom one point to another. Now if you shift the whole universe, rotate it, or let it evolve in time, things don't stay exactly the same. So you no longer havethese global symmetries, but Noether realized there arestill other symmetries left. See, no matter how you're moving, the laws of physics always look the same. That's general covariance, and it is a kind of symmetrythat holds everywhere. It means that in any small region, we can always changeour frame of reference. We can transform thepoints of space around as much as we like. And since these transformationsaren't global but local, these are called local symmetries. In a second theorem, Noether proved that forthese local symmetries, you no longer get proper conservation laws like we're used to in classical physics. Instead, you get somethingthat only works locally: a continuity equation. One example of a continuity equation describes the flow ofwater through a pipe. This first term tells you howthe amount of water changes in a section of the pipe, and the second tells you the difference between how much water is flowing out and how much is flowing in. In this case, the first term is positive because the water level in thispipe section is increasing, and the second term will be negative because less water is flowingout of the section than in. Together, the two termscancel to give zero, which guarantees that nowater is created or destroyed. If the total amount ofwater changes in a section, there must either be excesswater flowing in or out. In the case of general relativity, Noether found a similarcontinuity equation, but with an important difference. Imagine that now our pipes arelittle patches of space-time, and the water is energy flowingfrom one patch to another. In any individual section, the continuity equation looksexactly the same as before, so that in any small region of space-time, energy is conserved. But when we link these sections together, we need to take into accountthe curvature of space-time. And this changes the equation. Now, it's as if there arelittle cracks appearing between different sections of pipe, between the local patches of space-time, and through those cracks,energy can leak out. In special activity,the pipe is imperturbable because the pipe is fixed. And in general activity, you know, we have to account for the energy that goes into otherkinds of change over time, and that gets correspondingly more tricky. [Derek] Now that wehave this new equation, we can see how it works by expanding it as asum of different terms. This first term is analogous to the continuity equation from before, the one which conserves energy within a local patch of space-time. But now we have all these extra terms. These describe thecurvature of space-time. So as energy decreases in the first term, these curvature terms increase. The energy that you lose fromthe system you're tracking, we now start attributing it to things like the gravitational field, which has changed 'cause thewhole universe is stretched. We have to account for the energy that we attribute to the action of the gravitational field as well because space and timethemselves aren't sitting still. And all of this can be described by the continuity equationNoether had found. But when she looked at it,she realized something. It was exactly equivalentto the Bianchi identities, the half-solution Hilbert had found. He had dismissed itbecause it only gave you proper energy conservationin an empty universe. But now Noether proved thatit was the best you could do in general relativity. With one paper, she haduncovered the source of all conservation laws, andshe had solved the problem in general relativity thateluded Hilbert and Einstein. She was so amazing. I mean, I would go out on a limb, and I would say thesetwo theorems are probably the most important theorems forphysics of the 20th century. [Derek] In the following years, the University of Gottingen took steps to make Noether'sposition more official, allowing her to do whatshe loved most: to teach. They made her a professor, and she even got a smallsalary starting in 1923. But all of that changed onthe 30th of January, 1933, when Hitler became chancellor of Germany. The Nazis banned Jewish peoplefrom working at universities, and almost immediately,one of her former students told the authoritiesof her Jewish heritage, and she was suspended. Despite this dismissal, she continued teaching inthe kitchen of her home. Then one day, one of her oldstudents knocked on her door. (hand knocking on door) Clothed in the brown shirtof the Nazi stormtroopers, Noether let him in. He had come to learn math, and Noether was happy to teach him. I love what this sortof shows about Noether. You know, she truly,deeply cared about math, and she wouldn't discriminate. Whether someone was wearinga Nazi shirt or not; she taught all. [Derek] But staying inGermany became untenable. Fortunately, with thehelp of other academics, she managed to obtain ateaching position at Bryn Mawr, a woman's college in America, where she would teach until her death. In an obituary for the New York Times, Einstein wrote that \"Fraulein Noether was the most significantcreative mathematical genius thus far produced since the highereducation of women began.\" The reason that Noether'stheorem is so important is that everybody justchanged their state of mind. All of a sudden, the physicistswere thinking about physics in terms of these symmetries. Physicists started applying these ideas to the quantum world too,realizing that charged particles like electrons also have symmetries. Electrons have a phase,which you can think of as an arrow pointing in some direction, but you can offset thisphase by any arbitrary amount so long as you do itsimultaneously for all electrons. And that doesn't changeanything physically, so there's another symmetry. So what does this offsetor gauge symmetry lead to? Well, it leads to theconservation of electric charge. In the 1960s and '70s, Noether's insights leddirectly to the discovery of new fundamental particles like quarks and the Higgs boson. It taught us where theforces of nature come from, and it even helped to explainthe origin of all mass in the universe. Noether's two theorems,although little known, are what has gotten us theclosest we've ever come to a theory of everything. But all of this and much more will be covered in a second video. So make sure you're subscribed to get notified when that video comes out. (radio waves whizzing) When Emmy Noether setout to study mathematics, she was following inher father's footsteps, but from there she forged her own path. And before long, she wascoming up with a whole theory that reshaped ourunderstanding of the universe. That is the great thing about learning. You start by following instructions, building on what othershave done before you. But then at some point, youstart asking your own questions; you start experimentingand making discoveries. I've loved watching my ownkids start this journey, and my longtime sponsor, KiwiCo,has been a big part of it. This month they sent me their Rapid-Fire Disc Launcher crate, and at first, we followedthe instructions carefully, putting it together step by step. But as soon as it was built, my kids immediately started experimenting. [Child] Can I launch it? Testing different launch techniques to better hit the target,changing the launch angles, and figuring out what wouldmake the discs fly farther. Without even realizing it, they were engaging with thesame questioning mindset that drives real scientific discoveries. So who knows, maybe a simple disc launcher will inspire a young scientist who will go on to make thenext great breakthrough in science or engineering. KiwiCo makes this easy by delivering everythingyou need in a single box, and they have projects for all ages designed by experts and tested by kids to make sure they'renot only loads of fun, but they also inspirekids to ask questions and get creative with learning. So if you want to try out KiwiCo, click the link in thedescription or scan this QR code. Use my code Veritasium to get 50% off your first monthly crate.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: Axiom of Choice in mathematics"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "you would think it obviously must be true, but if you accept it, you find there are now some line segments that have no length. A sphere without adding anything to it can be turned intotwo identical spheres. A hundred plus years of mathematics has beenbuilt on this axiom. It seems intuitive and it works, but it also creates ridiculous paradoxes. So, is it right? Well, it all starts withthe issue of choice. Try this, choose a number. I can just pluck a randomnumber from my head, like 37 or 42, but that is the human brain at work, not a mathematical process. In math, you can't trulypick things at random because formulas alwaysgive the same result, which is why computers don't have true random number generators. Instead, they usually run an algorithm on your current localtime to generate numbers that appear random. So if we can't pick randomly, how do we select anything in math? Well, the only way is tofollow a rule of some sort. So a rule could be alwayschoose the smallest thing. For example, if we're lookingat whole positive integers, the smallest is one. For prime numbers it would be two, easy, but what about the real numbers? That's any number, positive,negative, whole, fraction, even irrational like pior the square root of two. Now try to choose the smallest one. It's impossible. The real numbers stretchoff to negative infinity. Even if we try to fix our ruleby making it super specific, like choose the smallest number after one, we still get stuck. There's 1.01 and then 1.0001, then 1.00000000001 and so on. So really what number comes after one? If we can't begin to specifythe order of the real numbers, next and previous, firstand last, we're stuck. The ridiculous part is weknow we have infinite options, but despite that, we can'tfigure out how to just pick one. The mission to resolve thisbegan with one man in 1870. He took on the task of putting the real numbersin a definitive order, even if it killed him and it nearly did. Georg Cantor was a talentedGerman mathematician who found himself at thecenter of a firestorm after publishing one ofhis very first papers at the age of 29. For centuries, our understanding of infinity was heavilyinfluenced by Galileo's 1638 book. It raised a key question, arethere more natural numbers or are there more square numbers? Just looking at them, the squarenumbers are more spaced out and they only become moresparse the higher you go. So it would appear there are fewer squares than natural numbers, but Galileo realized hecould draw a line matching every natural number with its own square. And since he could makethis one-to-one mapping, that he knew that the two sets must be exactly the same size. So there are actually justas many square numbers as there are natural numbers. From this counterintuitive result, Galileo concluded that terms like more than or less than don't apply to infinity, how we normally use them. It's all just one bigconcept of foreverness and this view prevailed for centuries. In fact, it's how many people still understand infinity today, but 200 years on, Cantor wasn't satisfied. In 1874, he wondered what if there were twoinfinite sets out there that didn't map perfectly to each other? Would they be different infinities? So he set out to comparethe natural numbers and the real numbers between zero and one. Cantor started by assuming hecould perfectly map these sets to each other, one-to-one. So he imagined writingdown an infinite list with a natural number on one side and a real number betweenzero and one on the other. Since there is no smallest real number, he would just writethem down in any order. Assuming he now has acomplete infinite list, Cantor writes down another real number and to do it, he takes thefirst digit of the first number and adds one, then the seconddigit of the second number, and again, he adds one. He keeps doing this allthe way down the list. If the digit is an eight or a nine, he subtractsone instead of adding to avoid duplicates, and by the end of thisprocess, he has written down a real number between zero and one, but that number doesn'tappear anywhere in his list. It's different from the first number in the first decimal place, different from the second number in the second decimal placeand so on down the line. It has to be different fromevery number on the list by at least one digit,the digit on the diagonal. That's why this is calledCantor's Diagonalization Proof and it shows there must bemore real numbers between zero and one than there arenatural numbers extending out to infinity. Cantor had revealed something remarkable. Infinity doesn't come in just one size. Some infinities like the setof square numbers, integers or rational numberscan be paired perfectly with the natural numbers. You can literally count them,one, two, three and so on. So Cantor called thesecountable infinities, but then there are bigger infinities, Cantor called them uncountable. These infinities like theset of all real numbers, the complex numbers, theycan't be matched one-to-one with the natural numbers. Cantor's results rockedthe mathematical community. After all, how can something that continues forever bebigger than something else that continues forever? His work was labeled ahorror and a grave disease, but Cantor wasn't discouraged. His success only spurred himto pursue his even grander goal to show that even uncountablyinfinite sets could be placed in a definitive order. What Cantor called a well-order. For a set to be well ordered,he required two conditions. First, the set must havea clear starting point. And second, every subset,a collection of items from that set, must alsohave a clear starting point. So for example, the naturalnumbers are well ordered, there's a starting point, one, and any subset, say six, seven, eight, also has a clear starting point. In this case, six, you alwaysknow which number comes before and which comes next. But what about the integers? Integers stretch off toinfinity in both the positive and negative directions. Well Cantor realizedhe could just pick zero as the starting point and from there his orderingwent one, negative one, two, negative two, ranking theintegers by their absolute value, their distance from zero. It doesn't matter if youput the positives first or the negatives first, aslong as you are consistent. Ordering them this way isactually what allows us to map the integers to the natural numbers and see that both sets are the same size, but there are other ways wecould well order the integers. We could start with zero and then have one, two, three, all the way to positive infinity and then negative one,negative two, negative three, all the way to negative infinity. This is not how we're used to counting, but both of these optionsfit the definition of a well ordering. There's a clear starting point, zero, and all their subsets also havea definitive starting point. Cantor had successfully well ordered a set that was infinite in both directions, but it was only countably infinite. In his next book, he publishedhis well ordering theorem. It claimed that every set, even the uncountably infiniteones like the real numbers could be well ordered. The problem was he hadn'tactually proven this because he couldn't, everymethod he tried had failed, but there was one big reason that Cantor was so confident in his theorem. Cantor was a devout Lutheran and he believed God wasspeaking through him. He said, my theorystands as firm as a rock. Every arrow directedagainst it will return quickly to its archer. How do I know this? Because I have studied itfrom all sides for many years and above all because I havefollowed its roots so to speak, to the first infalliblecause of all created things. Belief notwithstanding,the well ordering theorem was a lofty claim to make without any mathematical proof. And so for the second time, the mathematical community attacked and ostracized Cantor. Leading the charge was Leopold Kronecker, the head of mathematics atthe University of Berlin. Kronecker completely dismissedCantor's work, labeling him a scientific charlatan anda corrupter of the youth. And Kronecker used to be Cantor's teacher. Cantor dreamed of joining himat the University of Berlin, but all his applicationswere mysteriously denied. So Cantor took the rejection personally. In 1884, he wrote 52 letters to a friend and every one of them bemoaned Kronecker. Soon Cantor sufferedwhat would be the first of many nervous breakdowns. He was confined to asanitarium for recovery. The only way he could prove everyone wrong was by well ordering the real numbers, but he couldn't find astarting point, literally. Once Cantor was releasedfrom the sanatorium, he stepped away from math, a broken man. And over the next 15years he taught philosophy and rarely dabbled in his old pursuits. Perhaps his greatest challenge came at the 1904 InternationalCongress of mathematicians. There, Julius K\u00f6nig, a respectedprofessor from Budapest, announced he had proof that Cantor's wellordering theorem was wrong. In the audience was not only Cantor but also his wife, two of hisdaughters and his colleagues. He felt utterly humiliated, but there was also another in attendance. Ernst Zermelo. Zermelo was a German mathematician who had recently developed akeen interest in Cantor's work and as he listened toK\u00f6nig's presentation, something felt off. Within 24 hours, Zermelohad pinpointed the problem. K\u00f6nig's proof containeda damning contradiction, and within a month, Zermellopublished a three-page article titled \"Proof That EverySet Can Be Well-Ordered\" and it was flawless. Zermelo's breakthrough camewhen he discovered something profound in Cantor's work, a mechanism which Cantoruses unconsciously and instinctively everywhere, but formulates explicitly nowhere. See, all along, Cantor had been assuming that he could make an infinite number of choices at once from any set, including uncountable infinitesets like the real numbers, but this was just an assumption. Nowhere in the mathematical rule book was this explicitly permitted and math is built onrules, specifically axioms. Axioms are simple statements we accept as true without proof. Zermelo realized Cantor'sassumption needed to be formalized into something that holds up in a system of proof. A new axiom that said, making all of those choices was possible. He needed the axiom of choice. The axiom of choicecan be said in the sense that if you have infinitely many sets and each set is notempty, then there is a way to choose one elementfrom each of the sets. For finite sets, this seems obvious, just go set by set and pick something. Even for infinite sets, it'seasy if there's a clear rule, like always choose the smallest thing, but sometimes there is no natural rule. In those cases when you're choosing from infinitely many sets, including the uncountable ones, you need the axiom of choice. We can't say how we're choosing, but the axiom makes all ofthese choices all at once. The axiom doesn't allow you to say which element you've chosen, only that infinitely manychoices are possible. So how does this new axiom enable us to well order the real numbers. Zermelo uses the axiom of choice to choose a number from theset of all real numbers. He places this number, let'scall it X1 into a new set, R. The axiom then allows him to choose another number from the subset of all reals minus the one taken out. He calls this number X2 and places it as thenext number in his set and he keeps doing this,taking the chosen number and placing it next, X3, X4, X5. Now it feels like he's choosingthese numbers one at a time, but in reality the choices are made from all possiblesubsets at the same time. As Zermelo indexes each numberwith the natural numbers, at first it might seem likehe'd run into a problem because the natural numbersare only accountably infinite, whereas there are way more reals. So he should eventually run out of labels, but we can count beyond infinity. We did it earlier when wecounted past positive infinity to get to negative one,negative two and so on. So we just need a new set of numbers that extends past the naturals,call the next number omega, then omega plus one,omega plus two, and so on. These omega numbers arenot bigger than infinity. They just come after infinity. They don't tell us howmany things are there, but they do tell us their order. So the next number we pullout, we'll label it X omega, then X omega plus one, Xomega plus two, and so on. This will continue until we match the size of the real numbers andour original set is empty. Now every real number is in our new set. There is a first number, X1, and every subset also has a first number. And just like that, we havesuccessfully well ordered the real numbers. This order looks nothinglike our familiar ordering. A billion could come before 0.2, but with this process, we can prove that a well ordering exists. And more than that, we nowhave a way to resolve our issue of how to choose mathematically. We can't pick a smallest real number, but now we can pick a firstreal number, our starting point, and we can do this for any set, meaning all sets can be wellordered no matter the infinity. So Cantor's well-ordering theorem and Zermelo's axiom ofchoice are equivalent. Cantor was so relieved. Zermelo had proved thewell-ordering theorem and well ordered the realnumbers all in under a month. Zermelo took something mathematicians had unknowingly relied on for decades and turned it into a formal axiom. He showed that understandingmath isn't just about numbers, it's about the logic behind them.

The axiom of choice mayhave been a new idea, but its use was anything but. Zermelo scanned dozens ofpapers from other mathematicians and realized they had alsobeen using the axiom all along, even those who hadcriticized Cantor's work. It just goes to showhow unintuitive it is that it's even an axiom. People had been using it forlike a decade, unknowingly. But this almost seems too obvious. Zermelo's proof didn't actuallyconstruct a well order. It just said one must exist, but can something exist ifwe can't actually build it? His proof also used anuncountable number of steps, was that even allowed? Some mathematicians arguedproofs should be finite, others accepted infinity,but only the countable kind and then things got worse. When mathematicians playedaround with the axiom of choice, it created disturbing results. One of the first came fromGiuseppe Vitali in 1905. Vitali used the axiom of choiceto build a set of numbers that shattered our idea of what it means for something to have length. So what Vitali does is hetakes every real number between zero and one and assigns it to one ofan infinite number of bins. Let's call these bins groups. So we want each real numberto end up in exactly one of our infinite bins. So how does he do it? Well, let's say we havetwo numbers, X and Y. If their difference, X minus Y is equal to a rational, that is one integer divided by anotherinteger, well then both X and Y will go into the same bin. But if we have two othernumbers, let's say P and Q and their differenceis not irrational, so it's an irrational difference, well then those two numbers will go into separate bins. So let's do some examples. If this is 3/4 minus a half, then we get a quarter andso both 3/4 and a half will go into the same bin. In fact, you can see that all rational numbersfrom this span, zero to one, they'll all end up in the same group. Now if you have irrational numbers, well it's not clear whetherthey will go into the same bin or not because for example, if we have the numberroot two over two minus say root two over twominus a quarter, well then that does have a rationaldifference even though each of these numbers is irrational. So these two numbers willgo into the same group, but if we have irrationalnumbers root two over two minus root two over three, well that gives an irrational difference. So root two over three willhave to go into a different bin and it will be joinedby all of the numbers it has a rational difference from. And in this way, you canassign each real number to exactly one of these bins. Next, Vitali used the axiom of choice to reach into each group and select exactly one number, which would be arepresentative of the group. So we could pull out 3/4from the rational group, root two over two from this group, root two over three fromthat group and so on. Though of course because we'reusing the axiom of choice, you don't actually know whatthat representative number is, just that you have one. So we could write it down like this. We have these representativesfrom each group and together they form the Vitali set. You can visualize this setas a collection of points between zero and one. Next, Vitali makesinfinite copies of his set and each one he shifts bya different rational number between negative one and positive one. So if you think about what that does, it's gonna move each representative number to be at the position of everyother number in its group. If we just had the one rationalnumber that we plucked out as a representativefrom the rational group, now we're gonna shift it byevery possible rational number between negative one and positive one. So it's going to end up atevery other position occupied by the other members of itsgroup, at least on the span between zero and one. So if you imagine now merging all of these infinite sets together, there's gonna be nooverlap between the points. And second, we are goingto have every real number between zero and one because on that span we haveevery member of every group. So now the question is what is the size of the Vitali set? Now we know that the union of those sets must begreater than or equal to one because we have every realnumber between zero and one, but also these points onlyextend out as far as negative one or positive two. So it must be less than or equal to three, but this is where the problem arises because what number for the size of the Vitali set could you add to itself infinitely many times and end up with a valuebetween one and three? There is no number like that. I mean if the size ofthe Vitali set was zero, you add it up infinitely,many times you still get zero. If the size of the Vitali setis a small positive value, then you add it up infinitely many times, you're gonna get infinity, not three. So we have a contradiction and the only way out isif the Vitali set itself is unmeasurable, which seems crazy. Non-measurable sets like theVitali set have no consistent definition of size or lengthor area or even probability. But math is built on the idea that everything can bequantified, whether it's distance, time, or weight, except nowthere are non-measurable sets and it seems like the axiomof choice is to blame. This was just the start of theuproar caused by the axiom. In 1924, two mathematicians, Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski usedit to show something that looks like a magic trick. They proved you couldtake a single solid ball and split it into just five pieces, and then by carefully rotating and moving those pieces, you could reassemble theminto two balls each identical to the one we started with, and you could keep going until eventually you havean infinite number of balls, infinity all from one. This sounds absurd, but we can actually see howit works by building a graph. Imagine you can move in four directions, up, down, left and right. After taking a step, say to the left, you get the same four choices,up, down, left and right, but if you go to the right, you'll end up back where you started. So the only rule we're gonna have is that you can't immediately reverse a move, and we'll keep repeatingthis at every step, drawing each new line, halfthe size of the previous one so it all fits on the screen. If we keep going, we'll end up with this infinitely branching graph. Looking at our graph, we canbreak it into five sections. There's the middlesection where we started, and then there are four other sections that are all identical, just rotated. So if we take this section to the left and we move everythingone step to the right, the top part ends up here,the bottom part here, and the leftmost part here, then we've almostrecreated the entire graph. The only thing we'remissing is this section, so let's add it back in, but we could have done the same thing in a completely different wayby taking the bottom section and moving it one step up. Now the leftmost part ends uphere, the rightmost part here and the bottom here. Again, we're just missing one section, so let's add it back in. But this means I can recreatethe entire original graph in two completely different ways. We took one graph, split it into sections, shifted the sections, so theleft section went to the right and the down section up and somehow ended up withtwo identical copies. This is exactly whatBanach and Tarski did, but with a ball, like ourgraph, we again have four moves. We can rotate the ballup, down, left or right, and again, our only rule is that we can't immediately reverse a move. And to make sure we nevercome back to the same point, every rotation will be by the same irrationalportion of a circle. We can pick a randomstarting point, mark it and then start rotating the ball. Each point is coloredbased on the direction of rotation used to get there. If we do this an infinitenumber of times, we end up with this collection of points. This is a countably infinite collection because we could list each rotation and assign it a natural number, but the surface of a ball hasuncountably infinite points just like the real number line. So if we want to cover theentire surface, we would need to repeat this process,but where do we start next? Since there are uncountablyinfinite possible starting points, we can't list them all and we wanna be sure to avoid any points we've already colored. So the solution is touse the axiom of choice. With it, we can choosingunique starting points, even though we can't say exactlyhow we are choosing them. Once we've coloredevery point on the ball, we can split the points into five groups, one for the starting points and four others based onthe final rotation used to arrive at those points. These groups can now be treated just like the sections of our graph. We can take the group of points that end with a left rotation androtate it to the right. Then we add in the group thatends with a right rotation, and just like that, we'verecreated our original ball and we can do it again makingan extra move to account for the starting points. We can equally take the groupthat ends with a down rotation and rotate it upwards. Then we add in the groupthat ends with an up rotation and our starting points, and now we've recreated ouroriginal ball a second time. Now, this is a bit ofan oversimplification, but it gives you theessence of how this is done. From one ball, we havecreated two identical balls of the same volume, and nothing stops usfrom doing this again. Two balls can becomefour, four become eight, and before you know it,you've got infinite balls. The axiom of choice issomething that's so obviously true and it's consequencesare so obviously false that you're like, whatthe hell is going on? This infinite duplicationis theoretically possible, but the catch is the groupswe split the ball into aren't simple shapes. They're actually non-measurable,just like the Vitali set, although the original ball has a volume and the duplicated balls have a volume, the step in between violatesour understanding of size. This is what allows the paradox to happen. Of course, those are notphysically plausible cuts, but like there's a moremeta physical question like, should this even remotely be possible if we could make such cuts? And the answer to almostevery human I know is absolutely not. The truth is no oneknew what was going on. That same year, Tarskitried to push the axiom of choice further proving itis equivalent to the statement that squaring any infinite setwould not increase its size. When Tarski first submittedthis work to a journal in Paris, the editor Lebesgueresponded dismissively, nobody's interested in the equivalence between two false statements. Not to be deterred, Tarskisent it to a different editor at the same journal, Freche, his response, nobody's interested in the equivalence of two obviously true statements. Tarski never submitteda paper there again. So math was in crisis for over 30 years with people not knowing what to believe. The question is, wait asecond, is this really an axiom or is this something that you can prove? In 1938, we finallystarted getting some answers. The Austrian mathematician, Kurt Godel, proved there is a world allthe other already accepted axioms of set theory hold true, and so does the axiom of choice. Then in 1963, Paul Cohenproved there's also a world where all the axiomsof set theory hold true except for the axiom of choice. This is kind of like theparallel postulate in geometry. You can think of geometry as a game. The first four postulates or axioms are like theminimum rules required to play that game, and then the fifth axiom selects the universethat you wanna play in. If you choose that thefifth axiom doesn't hold, so there are no parallel lines, then you're playing in spherical geometry. If you choose one parallel line, you're playing in flat geometry, and if you choose morethan one parallel line, then you're playing inhyperbolic geometry. All of these geometries are valid. It just depends on themath you want to do, and it's the same for the axiom of choice. The axiom of choice can neither be proven nor disproven from the other axioms. So as long as the otheraxioms are consistent, adding choice won't leadto any contradictions. Paul Cohen was awarded theFields Medal three years later for his groundbreaking result, as well as his other work inset theory, and after Godel and Cohen's work, most of the debates about the axiom of choice died down. In the end, what the hellis going on is that it's up to you whether you want tochoose for the axiom of choice to be a part of your system or not, and face the consequences of either having it or not having it. Despite the counterintuitiveresults created by the axiom of choice,like non-measurable sets and infinite duplication, it is incredibly useful,choice allows mathematicians to replace lengthy explicit proofs with more concise arguments. By proving statements in the finite case, many proofs can be extended to any infinite case in just one line. This reduces proofs thatcould have been 20 pages to just half a page. And the axiom of choicedoesn't just make math easier. It is essential to some proofs. There are many theoremswhere the general case can't be proven withoutusing choice somewhere. Now, some mathematicians stillprefer proofs without choice, even if it's harder, the proof has to be spelledout step by step to generalize to infinite cases, and thisprovides additional information. Some mathematicians spendtheir time studying universes without the axiom of choice to understand what happens when we remove it. But today, the axiom of choice is almost universally accepted. For the past 80 plus years,generations of mathematicians have been taught with choice as a given to the point where manywho use the axiom of choice might not even realizewhen they're doing it. If you don't includethe axiom of choice, then you're kind of working with both hands tied behind your back. It's very hard to make anyprogress on modern math. So the question was never really is the axiom of choice right? But rather is the axiom of choice right for what you want to do? (frequencies buzzing) (bright music)"}]}

You can extract some from your mouth, just gargle salt water and mix this with soap and rubbing alcohol. You'll get a gooey mass at the top. This is DNA. Most of it is yours, but some of it actuallycomes from bacteria living in your mouth. At 100 times magnification, you'll see these strings,which are coiled up DNA, proteins and debris, all clumped together. But looking at them ispretty much useless. I mean, even with a milliondollar electron microscope, you can't actually see thegenetic code that makes you you. So how do you read DNA? DNA. DNA evidence. DNA. Your family secrets. You are not the father. Diseases you haven'tbeen diagnosed with yet. Predicting or even diagnosing cancers. The tiny quirks of what makes you you. But for the vast majorityof human history, we have not been able to read it. It is completely illegible. All of this might stillbe impossible today, if not for one man who took a lot of drugs and stumbled upon a discoverythat unlocked DNA forever. Also, he was kind of a jerk. In the 1960s as a biochemistrystudent at Berkeley, Kary Mullis wasn't interestedin going to his classes. He was too busy taking LSD and lots of it. Mullis didn't takeuniversity very seriously. His PhD dissertation was filled with jokes and the committee refused to approve it until he, quote, cutall the wacko stuff out. But LSD fueled his eccentric genius, sparking all sorts of interesting ideas. It did trickle into his science. So for example, he wrote aletter to the journal Nature, which chronicled the, quote, entire universe from thebeginning to the end, and they published it, which is amazing. He was like 22 yearsold, they published that. After graduating, Mullis just bummed around for a bit. First, he gets a job in a cardiology lab, but he's just kind of so horrified at how many rats are being killed. So he starts writing fiction,he gets a job in a bakery. One day he's working in this bakery, and this guy, Tom White, walks in and it turns out Tom Whiteworks at this company. It's a biotech startup called Cetus. They sort of get to talking, and this guy offers KaryMullis, he offers him a job. White recommended Mullis to his higher-ups, saying \"Hire this guy Mullis, he's an excellent synthetic chemist. I knew he was a good chemist because he'd been synthesizing hallucinogenic drugs at Berkeley.\" Cetus was one of the firstbiotech companies in the world. It was founded in 1971. An exciting time when scientists were starting to figureout how to manipulate DNA. One of the most importantdiscoveries was actually made that year while researchersat Johns Hopkins were studying the bacteriophage. The phage is a virus that hijacks bacteria by injecting its DNA into the cell. The bacteria is thenforced to create copies of the phage until it explodes. But the researchers realized that some bacteria evolved defenses that make them moreresistant to the virus. Their defensive moleculeswould scan the phage DNA, looking for a specific sequence, and when they found a match,they would cut the DNA, turning it into useless strings. Scientists called theselittle scissor molecules restriction enzymes, and different types of restriction enzymes cutDNA at different places and they work on human DNA too. So the researchers extracted the enzymes to essentially create atoolbox of nanoscopic scissors that would allow them to cut DNA at will. Cetus was trying to use biotech like this to develop commercial DNAtests that hospitals could use to quickly diagnose diseases. But at the time, simple DNAtests like this were impossible. Say you want to detectsickle cell disease. I mean, you could justlook at the blood cells under a microscope, but Cetus wanted to prove that they coulddo it with a genetic test. And for one of those, you would start off with a sample of DNA. In each of your cells, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, and if you zoom into thetip of the 11th chromosome, you'll find the beta globin gene. This sequence of adenine,thymine, guanine, and cytosine nucleotidescontrols the shape of your red blood cells. And if you inherit aT instead of an A here from both of your parents, well, you're born with sickle cell anemia. But, you can't see any ofthis under a microscope. So how do you check these single letter mutations against DNA that's over six billion letters long? Mullis said that this was the equivalent to reading a license plate on interstate five in the dark from the Moon But luckily there was a way to do it. The first step is toseparate the beta globin gene from the rest of the DNA. So you can use restrictionenzymes on your sample to cut the DNA into littlepieces, all of different lengths, and the sickle cell mutation will be on one of these ribbons. But how does that help? Well, DNA is negatively charged so if you place your cut upsample into a porous material like a gel and apply a voltage across it, the DNA pieces will flowfrom the negative end to the positive end. But because they're all different lengths, shorter pieces of DNA willnavigate the gel pores quicker than longer ones. This is called gel electrophoresis, and it lets you separateDNA out by length. Its results are consistent enough that after the DNA is spreadacross the gel, you can see where different length strands end up. Near the start, you'll see DNA strands that are 10,000 base pairs followed by shorter ones,3000, 1000, and so on. And because you used specificrestriction enzymes, you can predict thatthe sickle cell mutation was sliced into a 2000 base pair segment. So it's in here. And now that we knowwhere the target DNA is, we can move on to step two, checking whether our sample actually has that mutation or not. If you soak the samplein an alkaline solution or heat it up to over 90degrees, the hydrogen bonds between nucleotides willbreak and the DNA will unzip. Now, the two strands will beable to pair to any other DNA as long as it's a match. As only pair to Ts and Gs only pair to Cs. You need a complimentary sequence. Scientists could take advantage of this by synthesizing shortpieces of DNA in a lab. These are called probes, and they can be designed tohave any specific sequence. So if the sickle cell mutation is CTGTG, you can create a probe thathas the complimentary sequence, GACAC, that will stick to it. And because normal DNAis supposed to be CTGAG, your custom probe won't be a good match. Now, the trick is to make thesesynthetic probes radioactive and add them in. So after a while, yourprobes will either pair to the DNA or just keep floating around. And if you wash your sample, any probes that didn'tpair will rinse off. So the final step is to checkthe sample for radioactivity. You can see that with sickle cell blood, there's a radioactive signal on the right. The probe found themutation and stuck to it. But in the case of normalblood, there's no signal. None of the probes paired,so there must be no mutation. There is also this otherhuge signal in both cases. That's because the probeswill match to other parts of the DNA too, not justto the sickle cell region. This is why you need toseparate the mutation out using the gel first. This technique was knownas the Southern Blot, and it worked, but there was a problem. It took days or even weeks. Every step of it is difficult and every step of it, it'slike super inefficient. The matching is inefficient. The radio-sensitive paperis really inefficient, and you have these technicians having to work with radioactive stuff. And it happened in away that it was so slow and cumbersome that it wasn't commerciallyfeasible in any way. Cetus wanted a DNA test that could be done in aday in a single test tube, and they were close. They developed a method that could test for sickle cell diseasein just seven hours. But this new test sufferedfrom a different problem. The signal was just too faint. You could hardly tell whether the sample had the sickle cell mutation or not because it would barelyreturn any results. Now, Kary Mullis didn't work on these cutting edge DNA tests. His job was to make thoseshort radioactive bits of DNA that would be used as probes. He wasn't even doing the interesting part. So he's just making these snippets. That's his job, and it is a slow, repetitive, extremely boring job. So while he's working there, maybe in part because he is bored, he's just obnoxious, he's like a really annoying person. He doesn't get along with anybody. He picks fights with like receptionists and security guards and his colleagues. He also was a womanizer, so he would be hittingon people all the time, which was at the sametime he was also married. There was one time where he threatened to bring a gun to work. Really like not someoneyou would wanna work with. But, one day they bring in this new machine into the workplace. This machine basically could synthesize these snippets all by itself. It's basically doing, youknow, a month of his work in like a day. Mullis, he's like, nowI both have free time and I have a lot ofthese little DNA snippets I can sort of play with and figure out like, what can I do with them? And now he doesn't reallyhave a lot of work to do. And also people don't like him at work. So he basically starts taking weekends in Mendocino County to just relax. As he was driving up to his cabin on a Friday night in the spring of 1983, Mullis let his mind wander. He thought about that new DNA test and was trying to thinkof a way to fix it. Then a thought struck him. What if instead of inventing a more powerful telescope to read a single licenseplate from the Moon, he just created more ofthat same license plate. His mind raced. Mulliscould see DNA chains floating all around him. \"Blue and pink images of electric molecules injected themselves between the mountain and my eyes.\" He wasn't on LSD, but his mind by then hadlearned how to get there. He could sit on a DNA molecule watching the reactions unwind. See, the whole DNA sequence around the sickle cell mutation was known. And because Mullis knew onestrand, by complementarity, he knew the other as well. So if he heated up the DNA and separated the strands, hecould design short bits of DNA that would pair to both strandsanywhere on the sequence. These would be his primers. Then, Mullis could use somethingcalled DNA polymerase. It's a special proteinthat attaches itself to sites like thesewhere primers are paired to the original DNA. The polymerase basically grabs nucleotides floating around and extends the primer. And the primer is built asa perfect complimentary pair to the strand of DNA it's attached to. This creates an identical copy of the initial double helix. Polymerase exists in everycell of every living thing. It is what's responsiblefor replicating DNA during cell division. But it will only ever build out a primer in one direction. It's kind of like a one-way street. You see each DNA strand startswith a phosphate molecule. This is called the five prime end. That phosphate is attached to a sugar molecule called deoxyribose, which holds one of the four nucleotides. And deoxyribose also connectsto the next phosphate, and so this pattern repeats. But the last deoxyribose molecule doesn't have anotherphosphate connected to it. So it ends with an OH group instead. This is the three primeend, our street exit. The three prime end on oneDNA strand is always connected to the five prime end on the other. The second DNA strandalways points the other way. And DNA polymerase needs an OH group to attach the next nucleotide. So it always builds onthe three prime end. But that wasn't a limitation,it was an advantage, and Mullis knew exactly how to use it. He could create two primersthat would bind to the DNA before the sickle cell mutation, each on a different strandpointing at each other. And if he added polymerase along with some spare nucleotides, it would have to extend both primers toward and over the sickle cell mutation. This would create twoseparate DNA segments, both with the mutation. A few miles down the road,he had another eureka. He could just do these threesteps again, Unzip the DNA, pair the primers, and usepolymerase to extend them. He now had four DNAsequences with the mutation and he could make that eight and then 16, 32, 64. And he realized that if herepeated this chain reaction 30 times, he would haveover a billion copies of that specific DNA segment, all with the sickle cell mutation. He could cover the entire Earth with identical copiesof the license plate. And if he designed different primers, he could change the length of the DNA section thatwould get replicated. This didn't only work forthe sickle cell mutation. As long as you knew thesequence for any part of any DNA, human, plant, bacterial, you could make copiesof that exact segment and the copies would grow exponentially, like a nuclear chain reaction. (upbeat music) Mullis had invented a DNA photocopier. He named it the polymerase chainreaction, or PCR for short. Immediately he stopped the car and scribbled his idea onthe back of a gas receipt. PCR consumed his thoughtsfor the rest of the weekend. \"It was difficult for me to sleep with DNA bombs exploding in my brain. What if I had not taken LSD ever? Would I have invented PCR? I don't know. I doubt it.I seriously doubt it.\" Monday morning, he burstsinto the office at Cetus Corp, and he pitches his idea. He's like, basically,look, hey, I came up with a DNA Xerox machine. Like, we are working so hard to read this tiny tiny thing. What if we made a billion copies of it? It would be so much easier. Mullis presented his idea at a company-wide seminar, but people started leavingbefore he was done. A lot of them are skeptical. They've heard him pitchcockamamie ideas before. The other thing is that theywere like, that's so simple. It had to have been tried beforeand it can't possibly work. Like, there must be a reason why this is not the way we're doing this. But Mullis was undeterred. He started his firstexperiment in September, 1983, trying to replicate a 400 basepair fragment of human DNA. After months of trying, hecouldn't get PCR to work. Human DNA was just too complicated. So he set his sights on a smaller fragment of bacterial DNA, just 25 base pairs. For months, he'd separate thestrands, attach the primers, add the polymerase, hopingto amplify that small section of bacterial DNA. By the summer of 1984, Mullis thought he had it \u2014 indisputableproof that PCR worked. But others at Cetus weren't convinced. His work was sloppy. He didn't have any controls or do repetitions of his experiments. Tom White and Norman Arnheim, another colleague atCetus said that \"No one but Kary believed the data he showed demonstrated what he said it did.\" \"Any independent scientistlooking at the data today would come to the same conclusion.\" Mullis took these comments personally. He constantly argued with his colleagues about these results andeven started a fist fight at one point. He waslosing credibility fast and everyone wanted him out. But White argued that PCR had potential, so Mullis was given a oneyear probationary period to prove that PCR could work, but he wouldn't be doing it alone. White, Arnheim and Henry Ehrlichassigned other technicians to develop PCR along with Mullis. And from there on out,this group of scientists worked overtime to make PCR a reality. And by spring 1985, aftermonths of painstaking trial and error, the group finally cracked it. They had definitive proofthat PCR was possible. With it, their new sicklecell diagnostic method worked like a charm and could be done in under 10 hours. But PCR was still just a concept with a huge problem. For each cycle, you neededto raise the temperature to 95 degrees Celsius to unzip the DNA, and then lower it to around 30degrees to allow the primers to pair and the polymerase to extend them. And then you would repeat that cycle, heating back up to 95 degrees. The problem was that the polymerase would get destroyed when it was heated up. It was extracted from E. coli bacteria and E. coli can only survive up to around 50 degrees Celsius. So you would have to stand there and manually add in more polymerase every time you cycled the temperature. And that was expensive and time consuming. You have to do thisloop like maybe 30 times for a piece of DNA you're looking at, and every time you gotta stop, you gotta add more polymerase. It was just getting inthe way of the vision and of the efficacy. This was like, yeah, itwas adding more time. It was adding moredifficulty to the process. But, it turns out a solution had been bubbling away in the background for over 20 years. In 1964, a microbiologist named Tom Brock was visiting Yellowstone National Park. He'd never been before, but when he got to theboiling hot springs, immediately the vivid hues of the yellow and orange water caught hiseye. Are these colors bacteria? Nobody thought that something could live at higherthan 60 degrees Celsius. But this professor ThomasBrock, this microbiologist, he was like, no, no, no, no, no. I think not only can thingslive at that temperature, I think things can liveabove 100 degrees Celsius. I think things can live in boiling water. Brock set up a lab nextto one of the springs and asked his undergraduate student, Hudson Freeze, to tag along. I mean, I wasn't even old enough to drink. So, we would go to the spring and collect the samples there, and then bring them back to thelaboratory for the analysis. So every day, oh, over about three or four days, I would go inand I would pick up this tube. So, a standard looking test tube. And I would go like that, and I'd flick it just to see if there was anything growing in there. Didn't see anything. You know, this is never gonna work. Third day, nothing, fourthday, ooh, look at this. There's a little something on the bottom. So I picked up the tube and shook it. And this time there was this this stuff that was going (whistles) like this. And I, well, that's interesting. So I got a little pipetteout, took a little drop, put it under a microscope. I still get goosebumps,man, I'll tell you. I still get goosebumps. I looked at it, andhere are all these worms just crawling around. I thought, my god, I'm thefirst person to the world that ever sees this. There was a graduate student in the lab. And so this graduate student said, well, I think we ought to callit 'Hudsoniae Freeziensis'. I mean, you do have a great name. And Tom said, no, no, you can't name it after a person, we're gonnacall it Thermus Aquaticus. And the graduate student and I both looked at each other - hot water? Man, that's not very creative. So it meant that if an organismwas gonna live out there, it had to have all of itsessential enzymes adapted, living at that temperature. So it was clear, boiling water is not going to knock these guys off, but we thought it had no applications. Brock and Hudson published their findings and stored a culture of Taq at the American Type Culture Collection, a database that preservesmicrobial samples. 16 years later, in the spring of 1985, Kary Mullis stumbled upon their discovery. He was looking for a polymerase that could survive thehigh heat of the PCR cycle and he had found it. At his suggestion, the group isolated thepolymerase out of Taq and tried it in a PCR test. The results were breathtaking. David Gelfand, the Cetus scientist who purified the new polymerase said, \"It worked like a charm. It worked better than anythingwe have ever fantasized. The holy grail had been achieved.\" Not only was Taq able tosurvive the high temperature of PCR, it thrived in it. These are the results withthe old E. coli polymerase. You can see that it amplifiedthe sickle cell DNA, but it amplified a lot ofthe background DNA too. So it was messy. That's because primerscan actually attach to DNA even if they aren't a perfect match, they just need a low enough temperature, otherwise the high kineticenergy peels them off. But with Taq, you never hadto lower the temperature below 50 degrees, so the primers wouldvirtually only ever bind to their target region. These were the results with Taq. It completely erased allof the background noise. You could sort of set it and forget it and come back, you know, 30 cycles later, a couple hours later and all of a sudden you have a billion of the thing you're looking for. PCR worked and it worked effortlessly. They could amplify anypiece of DNA they wanted, no matter how small the sample. Cetus realized they had a golden goose. But other companies like Perkin Elmer and Kodak were startingto catch onto their idea. And if anyone else even briefly mentioned the concept of PCR in their paper, Cetus would lose all rights to the patent. So they had to go public andthey had to do it quickly. The PCR group urged Mullis to publish a solo paperfirst, since PCR was his idea. But Mullis procrastinated. Afraid they would lose credit for PCR, the rest of the group was forced to publish an article ontheir own PCR research. So the first paper on PCR that came out in ScienceMagazine in December of 1985 listed Mullis as the fourth author. He was furious. By the time he got his own paper ready, no reputable journal wanted it. He remarked, \"Nature didn't call me. I wasn't one of the good old boys. Science rejected it too.\" He claimed the PCR group stole his work. \"My God, they're going to getaway with their little trick.\" But the group scrambled together to get Mullis the proper recognition. He became the face of PCR after giving a talk at amicrobiology symposium in 1986. But, it was too late. Shortly after, still fueledby his anger for the group, Mullis left Cetus. However, the work on PCRcontinued without him. And after he leaves,they come up with like, basically there are new PCR machines that do the whole thing for you. And basically these machines are now in like every lab thatdoes any kind of work with DNA anywhere. PCR was a huge success. Polymerase chain reaction test. PCR, PCR. It's a DNA photocopier. Measure remaining blood cancer cells that other tests can't detect. Everyone was using it. From DNA cloning and vaccines to detecting cancer and HIV, PCR was saving lives. It completely opened up everything, it revolutionized everything. P-P-P-PCR. PCR could amplify thetiniest sample of DNA. It supercharged forensics. Texas man should be freed from prison because new DNA evidence doesnot link him to the crime. Hundreds of wrongfully convicted people were freed and thousandsof criminals were caught. Families separated bywar could be reunited. We use PCR all the time, all the time. Everybody in our institute. Scientists even tried to use PCR on ancient DNA frominsects fossilized in amber. Sound familiar? Like it's completely takenover so much of our world. And right at the center of this takeover, Kary Mullis. Dr. Kary Mullis, a surfer,a scientist who proved that science can be fun. The world renowned inventorof polymerase chain reaction. What inspired you to invent this? It wasn't people, it was... Drugs, drug, drug, drugs, I'm experienced with drugs. In 1993, Mullis was awarded both the Japan Prize and the Nobel Prize inchemistry for his invention of the polymerase chain reaction method. Although it wouldn't haveexisted without his colleagues, Mullis made PCR hisstory and his story only. There were a lot of people who were like, he's such a fame hog. Like, he completely didn'tgive any of us credit. I invented PCR. After I had invented PCR. And now it's like theybought into his version of the story where he did this solo. Whereas there were a lot of people at Cetus Corp who helped him. As Erlich remarked, \"To Kary, rewritinghistory was more important than writing papers.\" \"He seems to have viewed PCRas a means to a celebrity.\" He left Cetus and as far as I could tell, really stopped being a scientist. ... realized, I had in my hands the thing that would make me famous, 'cause I knew that night I was gonna get a Nobel Prize for that. He used his publicity tospringboard his eccentric views. He talked about seeing glowing raccoons and being abducted by aliens. He would go around sayingkind of crazy, shocking stuff. Distrust your fellow man. We're an arrogant littlebunch of naked apes. He wrote this book called \"Dancing Naked in the Mind Field\", which the blurb on the book is amazing. It's from the WashingtonPost, and it's like: \"The strangest guy to ever winthe Nobel Prize in chemistry. He just would do like weird stuff. Did you see me eating those leaves? Was that a drug? He was an expert witnessin the OJ Simpson trial. He started a company where he would PCR DNA from famous dead celebrities like Marilyn Monroe. And then he would makelike little trinkets out of them and sell them. But not all of hisideas were as harmless. He didn't believe in global warming. He didn't believe in the ozone hole. He didn't believe that HIV caused AIDS. HIV is not deadly. There'snot something called AIDS. In the early 2000s, HIVdenialism in South Africa was at a high, while the country was battlinga crippling AIDS epidemic. What we are facing is a catastrophe, which is indescribable. President Thabo Mbeki was under the influenceof AIDS denialists. Does HIV cause AIDS? How does the virus causea syndrome? It can't. An even invited Nobel Prize winner, Kary Mullis, to weigh in on the issue. Under Mbeki's leadership,the government refused to provide adequatetreatment for those affected. And more than 330,000 people died. Kary Mullis passed away inAugust, 2019 at the age of 74 due to complications from pneumonia. Nonetheless, the legacy of PCR lives on. Just a year later, the method reached perhapsits most significant use yet, as PCR COVID tests helped keep billions of people safe throughout the pandemic. Sometimes he's like, he'svery funny and charming and a good storyteller, but he's also, you feellike he's a very sleazy guy. He's like not a personyou'd want to be around. He did have a sort of, a sparky mind. He was not being forced by some company to discover something. He was playing. It was like imaginative play. He was like, I have these snippets and what could I do with them? And to me, he invented the solution, and then like a huge field of problems emerged to fit. But maybe the real takeawayfrom Mullis's story is about automation. I mean, he discovered PCR partly because his day-to-day jobwas taken over by a machine. And this is a pretty important point because all of us are maybestaring down the barrel of a future where machinestake over our jobs, especially now with the surgeof AI and generative models. And that's pretty scary. But it could also forceus to come up with bigger, more creative ideas, justlike it did for Kary Mullis. Automation might open ourminds to breakthroughs and discoveries thatcould change the world. (upbeat music) Of course, making breakthroughs like PCR take more than just opportunity.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: science of avalanches, including their causes, types, prevention, and safety measures"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "what causes them, how destructiveones can be prevented, and what to do if you'reever caught in one. To actually feel the forceof the avalanche on your body. There's kind of nothing thatcan prepare you for that. [Derek] For this video, we followed around the ski patrollers at North America's biggestski resort, Whistler-Blackcomb to trigger avalanchesand film them up close. If you've ever driven throughthe mountains in winter or have gone skiing at aresort, you were kept safe by the knowledge gainedby snow scientists, avalanche forecasters, and ski patrollers. If you Google the deadliest avalanche, the first result will be from May, 1970, when the town of Yungguy and 10 nearby villages were destroyed. An estimated 30,000 people were killed, but the avalanche was triggered by a 7.9 magnitude earthquake, and the avalanche caused alandslide which buried the town. So it wasn't really avalanche destruction. The deadliest snow avalancheshappened in December of 1916 during World War I. Some of the fighting tookplace in the Dolomites, mountain range in northern Italy. There thousands of Italian troops were battlingAustro-Hungarian soldiers, and it had been aparticularly snowy winter. Over 12 meters of snow had fallen on the mountain range in the first week of December. On the 13th of December, a single avalanche wiped outthe Austrian barracks near Mount Marmolada killingat least 275 people. But its flow on effectswere far more devastating. Both sets of troopsrealized they could use snow as a weapon, so soldiers onboth sides fired artillery shells into the mountainabove their enemy's camps, deliberately triggering avalanches. Over the next few days, between 2000 and 10,000 soldiers diedburied underneath the snow. But most deadly avalanchesaren't triggered by earthquakes or artillery shells. They're triggered by skiers, snowboarders, and snowmobilers recreatingin the backcountry. 93% of fatal avalanches in the US were triggered by the weight of the victim or someonein the victim's party. So how could something so massive and destructive be triggered by the weight of just a single human? This is Bruce Tremper. He literally wrote the bookon avalanches, the book, which inspired us to make this video. I was a a hardcore ski racer, but when I was done racing,then I started building lifts for the Bridger Bowl Ski Patrol, and I got caught in my first avalanche. My job for that day was tightening all the bolts at the baseof each chairlift tower. 'Cause we were doingour load test that day. So then they'd warn me,okay, once you get done with this tower, whateveryou do, don't cross that big avalanche path below it. And I made some snide remark like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I knowabout all that stuff. Don't worry about me.\" When I got done tightening those bolts, then I realized I madea really serious error because I was justwallowing up to my chest and I almost needed to take out a shovel and dig like a tunnel throughthe snow to get back up to the ridge and it wasjust exhausting work. And then I got cocky. I thought, \"Well, I'veheard about these ski cuts. I can just build up my speedand get to the other side 'cause that's where I want to be anyway.\" Like an idiot, that's what I did. The first thing that happenswhen an avalanche brakes is it just starts moving and the first thing you do iskind of flop over on the snow. 'Cause you lose your balance. Like somebody pulls therug out from underneath you and you fall uphill. And there I was justkinda laying in the snow, getting dragged down themountain, you know, I was caught. I couldn't get out of it and luckily I was ableto grab a small tree, but the snow was just beating me to death, and just about snappingoff my neck as it's going by me on this tree. Luckily a lot of that snow went by and that's why I didn't die that day. But then it finally, thetree finally snapped off or something happened and I was tumbling downthe avalanche path. Luckily when I got to the bottom, I was only buried up to my chest. I was in the tail of the avalanche and the avalanche diesfrom the tail first. So that slows down whilethe front part keeps moving. You know, I had a lotof time to think about that for the rest of the day. Tightening the rest of those bolts and thinking, holy smokes,I should, I could have died. I should have died and I didn't. You were tightening bolts,you were caught in avalanche and then you went back totightening bolts that day. You like, you went back to work. Oh yeah, yeah. Good job.- Well, somebody had to do it. I was the guy, that was my job. You know, that's how Iwas raised by my father. You get the job done. At the most basic level, an avalanche happens whenthe crystalline bonds between the snow crystals break and the force of frictionholding the snow on the mountain isn't enough to counteractthe pull of gravity. Avalanches are categorized by size on a scale of one to five. One would not be largeenough to bury a person, but size five would involvea 100,000 cubic meters of snow traveling, many kilometers causingdestruction on a massive scale. The first thing to note isthat snow isn't uniform. The snow pack is builtup one storm at a time, so it's layered and theselayers aren't all the same and they change over time, due to the conditions they're exposed to, the air temperature, humidity, sun, wind, and rain all affect thestructure of the snow. For example, after fresh snow has fallen, if there's a warm sunnyday, the snow will melt and then refreeze overnightcreating a sheet of ice. The most important conditionis the temperature gradient in the snowpack, but we'll come to that. The snowpack preservesa record of everything that has happened to it. If you dig a pit into the snow, you can read the differentlayers to understand its past. Nine different avalancheproblems are recognized, but there are two maintypes, slab and loose. There are two types ofloose avalanches, dry loose, and wet loose. The snow in dry looseavalanches is well, loose. The snow isn't all stuck together. So after it's triggered, it fans out. Sometimes loose avalanches are also known as point release avalanches. Dry loose avalanches are commonlyknown by skiers as sluff, and they usually aren't a serious hazard, though they can drag a skier off a cliff. It's funny because likein the skiing community, we've just said like this one kind of avalanche isn't an avalanche, we just call it something else. I had a run in with sluffyesterday, a Helbronner, and you just feel like this wall of snow pushing you from the back. Honestly, it's kind of fun, it's fun. It's like, it's kind of likesurfing where it's dynamic and it's moving and you haveto keep moving with the terrain because you know that yeah,the sluff his behind you and if you're not moving fastenough, it's gonna get you. [Derek] Another type ofavalanche is wet loose. It typically happens around spring on like south facing aspects. The sun heats up the snowand makes it more dense and slushy and runny. The sun's starting to come out. I'm not currently too worriedabout wet loose right now, but I will be in about an hour. [Derek] But the more deadly avalanches are slab avalanches where the top layer ofsnow becomes stuck together like a cohesive slab. When the avalanche is triggered, the snow releases together in big chunks. The prevalence of slab avalanches depends on the angle of the ski slope. Under 25 degrees, there isn'tlikely to be a slab avalanche because gravity just isn't strong enough to pull the snow down the mountain. Any slope steeper than 50degrees is also unlikely to have dangerous avalanches. The slope is so steep that it's hard for much snow to accumulate. Regular small sluffs and slab avalanches preventthe buildup of larger, more dangerous slabs. 75% of dangerous slab avalanches occur between 34 and 45 degrees. For comparison, a blackdiamond ski run is typically around 30 degrees and a doublediamond is around 40 degrees. In other words. The best conditions forskiing are also the best conditions for avalanches. [Derek] What's reallyterrifying about slab avalanches is you can trigger them remotely. You could be skiing or walking on a slope thatis far less than 30 degrees and trigger an avalanche ona steeper slope above you. And slab avalanches are fast. They can reach speeds upto 120 kilometers per hour. Friends of mine havebeen killed that way. You just don't realize how far these cracks canpropagate through the snow. [Derek] Slab avalancheshave three parts to them, bed surface, which is thelower part of the snow. Then there is a weak layerand the overlying slab The bed surface and theslab are strong layers. That is they're made out ofsnow that sticks to itself. The kind of snow that youcan make into a snowball. The shape of the snow crystals in strong layers tends to be rounded. In contrast, the weak layerconsists of snow crystals that don't readily cohere to one another. These tend to be moreangular or faceted crystals. But there are a fewdifferent weak layer types. One of the most worryingis known as surface hoar. It's not made outta snowthat falls from the sky. It grows on the surface of the snow. On cold clear nights,the surface snow radiates a lot of its heat away becomingeven colder than the air. Since warm air holds moremoisture than cold air, that moisture will crystallize at the top of the snow creating surface hoar. Surface is formed by condensation. It's the snow equivalent of dew. It's really angular and itdoesn't want to stick to itself. Usually surface hoar isthen broken down by wind or sun melting it. [Derek] But if a snowstorm occurs, just after these crystals have formed, they can become buried. And in that case, they createa very nasty, weak layer, which is just perfect for avalanches. Another weak layer to worryabout are facets, snow crystals that used to be round, but that became angular in the snowpack. Facets develop when there'sa strong temperature gradient in the snow. A thermal gradient of less than one degree per 10 centimeters doesnot produce facets. Anything more than that can,which is why the temperature inside a snow pit is measured. If there's a large thermal gradient, there could also be a weak layer Right above and right below crust, there can be really wildtemperature gradients. So we had it down 10centimeters, it was minus 5.5 and down 20 it was minus 3.7. So that's two degree difference. [Derek] The bottom of the snow is warmer than the top of the snow. So the warmer snow near the ground, sublimates turningstraight from solid water into water vapor. This water vapor risesup through the snow pack and then encounters thecolder snow crystals. At this point, it refreezesand forms faceted crystals, which like surface hoar,don't stick together creating a weak layer. The bigger the change in temperature, the faster the snow crystals change and the faster they change, if they change quickly,it can promote faceting which promotes instability. [Derek] The other importantfactor in slab avalanches is the stiffness of the slab. Since the snow is cohesive,when a force is applied and the interface between the slab and the weak layer startsto slip, that force, and hence the slippage propagates. While stiffer slabs mightresist initial triggers better, their failure leads to more propagation, leading to larger avalanches. This also results in more remote triggers. Avalanches are common after storms. The extra weight of the snow exerts an additionalload onto the snow pack, which can trigger the weak layers deeper in the snowpack to slide. The vast majority ofavalanches occur during or right after a storm, in other words- The best conditions for skiing are also the bestconditions for avalanches. Strong winds also increasethe risk of avalanches. The wind can pick up and transport the snow fromopen to more sheltered areas. As the snow accumulates, the wind pressure compactsthese snow particles as they're deposited, whichcreates a dense, cohesive layer. These newly deposited layersof snow are called wind slabs. Wind slabs can be quiteunstable, especially shortly after formation, if they'veformed over a weak layer. Since they're more cohesive, these slabs can break free as large chunks during an avalanche makingthem particularly hazardous. Another concern are cornices. Cornices form when the wind blows snowover the top of a ridge and it piles up on the otherside hanging over the edge. Cornices can weigh many tons and when they fall onto a slope, they can trigger massive slab avalanches. One of the ways that backcountryskiers test the stability of the slope they're about to ride is by dropping a cornice onto it. If the slope didn't slideunder the weight of a cornice, it's unlikely to slideunder the weight of a skier. So how are avalanchesprevented in ski resorts? For this video, Veritasiumproducer Peter, went out with the ski patrol teamat Whistler-Blackcomb, which is North America'slargest ski resort. Dude, I'm pumped, reallypumped, really anxious, really stoked, should be a good day. There are sections in ski resorts that are avalanche terrain,slopes that are greater than 30 or so degrees or under avalanche terrain. To keep skiers safe,before ski areas open, the ski patrols do avalanche control work. Fundamentally, it boils down to them triggeringavalanches in a safe way before there are any skierson or under those slopes. This is done often enough so that the snow doesn't geta chance to build up too much. So the avalanches thatare triggered are smaller. There are a few ways that this is done, but the most common isby using explosives. Explosive charges with atwo minute fuse are lit and then detonated on theslopes where they are likely to produce avalanches. Oh boy, really gladI put on those goggles. Sometimes this is done by throwing the chargersout of a helicopter, but a lot of the timethis is done on skis. There are even special tramswhere the chargers are attached to a carabiner and then shuttled across to a hard to access slope. As the charge detonates, the shockwave breaks the weaklayer leading to an avalanche. Yes, we got a slide, that wasn't too bad. It wasn't great. It was something.- It was something. [Peter] Despite doingthe shoot the day after one of the biggest storms of the season, we weren't particularly luckywith getting large avalanches. We shot all morning and only got this relatively small slide. So I was getting worried and then we were able to get this shot. (upbeat music) Oh my god, look at that, oh. Avalanche control workis also done on roads with basically the sameidea, trigger avalanches before they get a chance tobecome big and destructive. For example, the Trans Canadahighway connecting the east and west coast of Canada goes through Rogers Pass, a mountain pass with 3000 meter toll peakson either side of it. The road is right next to a mountain that's actually called Avalanche Mountain. Here Parks Canada and the Canadian Armyconduct avalanche control by firing artillery shells at one of the 270 preset targetson the nearby mountains, releasing small avalanches before they get a chance to become big and destructive and damage the highway. [Derek] Deaths fromavalanches do occasionally occur in bounds at resorts,but they are very rare. Due to the diligentwork of ski patrollers, most avalanche injuries and deaths occur in the back country. It's kind of crazy 'cause as a skier, you hear so much about avalanches. (speaker speaking in a foreign language) You realize it's deadlyand people die every year. (speaker speaking in a foreign language) But to actually like feel the force of the avalanche on your body, like there's kind of nothingthat can prepare you for that. (snow thudding) Every time I hit the ground Iwould just like dig my hands in my feet in like try to like claw myself down onto the ground while also like trying to protect my head. I knew also like themoment the snow stopped, if I was still in thesnow, I would be buried. I wouldn't be able to move, I would be counting on my buddy to find me and dig me out and save me. (exhales heavily) (speaker speaking in a foreign language) This wasn't a hugeavalanche, this was a size two, so like big enough to burya car but not like a house. So I was actually ableto stop on the slope before it flattened out where the snow would accumulateand I would be buried. (speaker speaking in a foreign language) Yeah, it was intense, really intense and I felt really stupid because it was the firstmountain I ever skied on as a kid was thismountain, like this very slope and so I was just so comfortable with it and like didn't think twice about the fact that it was avalanche terrain and the snow or, I mean we did check the snow up top, but I don't know, Iwasn't like fully tuned into to the dangers that are present. Like the moment you stepinto avalanche terrain, something like that can happen. So the three things that you need to bring when you go backcountry skiing is a beacon, which is this thing, a probe, which is this big, long stickthat ends up collapsing. So it does fit in yourbackpack and shovel. [Derek] If you're buriedin a slab avalanche, it's almost impossibleto dig yourself out. During an avalanche, thesnow gets mixed around and friction heats it upso it melts a little bit and then when the avalanche stops, it refreezes, setting like concrete. And that's why if you're fullyburied, you need someone else to find you and dig you out. This is why in 1968 theavalanche beacon was invented. The beacon is a transceiver,so it is both a transmitter and a receiver of electromagnetic waves at 457 kilohertz. So right now it is send mode. So this is the mode it would be on if I'm skiing in the backcountry and if there's an avalanche, what would happen isit'll keep sending out those electromagnetic wavesin all of these directions. Then my buddies would changefrom send mode to search mode and start looking for that signal. And what that looks like is that Aaron is two meters away from me and her beacon is onand it's saying, cool, there's a person twometers away from me, so. Around 25% of avalanche fatalities are from trauma hitting a tree or a rock or being pushed off a cliff. The rest are from asphyxiation. If you're buried in an avalanche and your face is under the snow, there's a small airpocket for you to breathe. The snow is initially porous,but the heat from your body and breath melts the snow, which refreezes formingan impermeable bubble. As you breathe, the concentration of CO2 in that bubble increases and the amount of oxygen decreases until you die from asphyxiation. If your friends find and dig you out in the first 10 minutes, you have an 80% chance of survival. 15 minutes in, that chance drops to 40%, 30 minutes in, you have justa 22% chance of survival. So time is key. There is another inventionthat could save your life, which is an avalanche airbag. If a skier triggers an avalanche,they can pull on a cord, which activates the airbag. The airbag rapidly inflates. Historically this wasdone with compressed air, but newer versions usebattery powered fans. The airbag increases the skier's buoyancy, making it less likely for them to be buried deeply in an avalanche. An added benefit is thatif the skier is buried as the airbag deflates, it leaves a larger airpocket providing more time to be rescued. Avalanche airbags decreasethe chances of death by nearly half. Around 30 people in the USdie in avalanches each year, plus an additional hundred in Europe. Most of them are backcountryskiers, snowboarders or snowmobilers, and they very likely triggered the avalanche that killed them. Avalanches are beautiful, majestic, and completely terrifying. If you go into the backcountry in winter, please carry a shovel,a probe, and a beacon, but also check the avalanche forecast and make good decisions when heading out to avalanche terrain. Because the best wayto survive an avalanche is not to be caught in one.

It took 15 deaths for theauthorities to realize that these people were gettingkilled by... their fridges because fridges back then wereno longer just boxes of ice. Instead, they reliedon a chemical looping through the back to stay cold. And the best chemical forthe job was methyl chloride, a toxic and virtually odorless gas. So if it somehow leaked from the fridge, it could kill you without warning. Other fridges usedflammable gases instead, so a leak combined witha spark from the stove, and your house couldsuddenly go up in flames. So one company triedto solve this problem, but in the process, they accidentally created aseemingly magical substance. Soon, it made its way intoa huge range of products, which were so popular they ended up in nearly every home in America. But what people didn't know was that these products came at a price. The chemicals used to make them were being released into the environment, slowly poisoning everyoneon the planet, including me. (swelling music) You have high levels of achemical you never heard of. It shocks me. Like, where could this have come from? Almost every living creature, from polar bears to birds to fish, massive worldwide contamination by completely manmadechemicals that are fingerprints back to just a couple of companies. This is a video about one of the biggest chemicalcoverups in history. For legal reasons, I want tonote that this investigation is based on publicly availabledocuments, recordings, and third-party opinions. All sources are linked in the description. The story all began withan attempt to save lives. In 1936, a chemical companycalled DuPont set out to find a safer alternativeto the gases used in fridges, one that was neither toxic nor flammable. Their lead scientist on the project was a 27-year-old chemistnamed Roy J. Plunkett. He was experimenting with a gas calledtetrafluoroethylene, or TFE. It's a pair of double-bonded carbons, each bonded to two fluorine atoms. One morning, as Plunkettwas setting up a test, his assistant picked outa cylinder full of TFE and twisted the valve, but nothing came out. Plunkett thought the gas must have leaked, but the cylinder still weighedabout as much as a full one, so he grabbed a saw andcut the cylinder in half. Inside, he was shocked to see it was full of a white, slippery powder. So what happened to the gas? Well, what the chemist reasoned was that under the highpressure of the cylinder, one of the double bonds between the carbons inTFE must have broken. And now those two carbon atomseach had a bonding site free. So one of them probablygrabbed onto a carbon from a different TFE molecule,breaking its double bond. And then that molecule did the same, and the process repeated again and again until all of the TFE wastrapped in these long chains. The gas had polymerized intopolytetrafluoroethylene, forming this slippery powder. Plunkett just wanted to get rid of it because it ruined his experiment. But before throwing it out, he decided to do some tests on it. So he tried pouring water on it, but the water just beaded off. So he tried acid. Again, nothing happened. Then he tried the strongest base he had, but that wouldn't melt it either. Plunkett went through allof the solvents in the lab, but the powder remained intact. It wouldn't melt, corrode,or react with anything. It was seemingly indestructible. The reason it was so indestructible was because of this bond,the carbon-fluorine bond. See, out of all of the elements,fluorine is the greediest, the most electron-hungry atom. Its outer shell is a single electron away from being complete, whichwould make it perfectly stable. So fluorine really, reallywants that electron. And because it's so smallcompared to most other elements, the protons in its nucleus can get close to the electrons of other atoms. And because of their positive charge, they pull on them really hard. So near a carbon atom, fluorine grabs onto oneof the carbon's electrons to complete its outer shell, and this keeps the twoatoms bonded together. But the fluorine isn't done there. It keeps tugging onthe carbon's electrons, pulling them closer to itself, which makes fluorineslightly negatively charged and the carbon slightly positive. So now there's an electrostatic attraction that makes this bond even stronger. Now, in reality, electronsbehave more like fuzzy clouds than the orbiting pointsin this animation, but the principle still holds. In terms of energy, this is actually the strongest single bond a carbon can form. So if other atoms or molecules get close, they're essentially ignored. And Plunkett's magic powderwas completely covered in carbon-fluorine bonds, so it hardly reacted with anything. Okay, so he is got thisincredibly inert stuff. Was he really trying to get rid of it? He actually didn'tknow what to do with it 'cause like what do youdo with the material that doesn't, you know,react with anything? But luckily his employer, DuPont,they were actually working with the US Army on the Manhattan Project. So they were refininguranium and plutonium 'cause of course there'sa World War II reference in a Veritasium video. You just have to have it. To get the fuel for nuclearbombs, enriched uranium, you first have to turn the uranium into a gas, uranium hexafluoride. It was a nasty chemicalthat corroded everything. So all the gaskets, seals, and miles of pipe inthe plant at Oak Ridge had to constantly replaced,slowing down production. But then DuPont was like, \"Listen, we have this seeminglyindestructible chemical, right? It doesn't react withstuff it doesn't corrode, so maybe we can try and use it against uranium hexafluoride.\" So they get a bunch of this powder, they cram it together under high pressure to create these cakes, essentially. Now you had a solid of this material that you could machineinto gaskets and cylinders that you could push into these pipes and put these tube linings into the pipe, and boom, it works likemagic, like a charm. The uranium hexafluoride was no match for this magic material. As Gordon Fee, the manager of the nuclear weapons plant, put it, \"There was never a substituteconsidered, as far as I know.\" The material worked so well that the army wanted touse it for everything. The same gaskets and sealswere installed into fuel tanks and airplane engines to protectthem from oil and water. And weapons manufacturingplants no longer had issues with the corrosive nitric acidneeded to make explosives. DuPont saw the potential too, so they trademarked the material in 1944. They didn't trademark it under the name polytetrafluoroethylene 'cause, admittedly,that name kind of sucks. So they took T-E fromtetra, F-L from fluoro, and then they had a bunch of these other miraclematerials, rayon, nylon. So they took O-N from the endof those, and boom, Teflon. Nice. Okay, that's a good name. Under the army's order, DuPontramped up Teflon production at their test plant inArlington, New Jersey, giving their wholesupply to the government. But DuPont struggled toproduce enough Teflon to meet the military's demand. As their Arlington scientists put it, the major advantages ofpolytetrafluoroethylene, solvent resistance andhigh thermal stability, offer obstacles from thestandpoint of ease in fabrication. You could only reallymold Teflon into solids, so gasket, seals, pipes, but you couldn't put itinto water to make a spray because it doesn't dissolve in water. They actually didn't knowanything that dissolved Teflon, but there was an even biggerproblem at that point. To polymerize TFE into Teflon,you can add a reactive atom or molecule that will hijackthe first carbon double bond and start the reaction. This is called the initiator. And the bond formed betweenit and the first TFE molecule releases a small amount of energy. Then a bit of energy is also released when the next TFE molecule joins the chain and the next and the next. And if the process isn't controlled, the reaction gets very hot very quickly. And if it gets above 200 degrees celsius, TFE rapidly decomposes intocarbon and tetrafluoromethane, which releases evenmore energy all at once. This caused a massive explosion at the Arlington plant in1944, killing two workers. You need a way to dissipate the heat, take the heat away from the reaction without it staying in there and, therefore, expandingand creating that force. Yeah, and one of the ways to do that was to have the reactionhappening in water, because water can absorba huge amount of energy before it ever heats up. But if you inject TFEinto a water cylinder, the gas doesn't dissolve. Even at high pressure, mostof the TFE just stays on top. So if you add an initiator, the polymerization istriggered in one place, and so it can still cause an explosion. What you need is some way to disperse the TFEthroughout the water first. And to do that, DuPont needed help. In 1951, they purchaseda special acid from 3M, the company behind Scotch Tape. This acid, called PFOA, looked almost exactly like Teflon. It had a chain of eight carbonatoms covered in fluorines, but at the other end, therewas a double-bonded oxygen and an OH group. That's what makes it an acid. And since there were eightcarbons in the chain, DuPont also referred to the acid as C8. The tail end of C8, likeTeflon, was hydrophobic, but the acid head group loved water, it was hydrophilic. So when you add C8 into water, the molecules rearrange themselves so that the heads touch the water, but the Teflon-like tails don't. They create little bubblesall throughout the water, which are virtually dry on the inside. If you now inject TFE andstir the whole mixture up, well, the hydrophobic gas ends up in the middle of these C8 bubbles. And those bubbles are dispersed everywhere evenly throughout the water. You know what this reminds me of, is soap. So it's the great combiner that allows, like, oil and water to mix. And now if you sprinklein initiator molecules, the initiator moleculesalso go into these bubbles. They start the polymerization reaction, so from TFE to Teflon. But now since it's happening spread all throughout these bubbles,the heat is evenly dissipated throughout the water, and no one explodes. And since Teflon is nowsuspended in a solution, you can spray it ontosurfaces like a coating. This thing doesn't stick to anything. How do you stick it to the gaskets? You know, how do you actually use it? Yeah, yeah, yeah,that's a good question. So the trick was actually the surface had to be really rough. So what you do is yousandblast it to create grooves and imperfections at this,like, nanoscopic level. Now if you spray the coating on, what happens is, if you heatit up, the water evaporates, the C8, it also evaporates, but Teflon, instead of itevaporating, it just softens up. So although there's nochemical interaction here, now it's mechanicallystuck to the surface. That's how they got it to stick. (suspenseful music)(quirky music) With the war over, the army lifted the secrecybans on the Teflon patents, and DuPont was allowedto sell it commercially. And suddenly, people all over the world were coating everyday items in Teflon, trying to create a world-changing product. One day in 1954, a Frenchengineer, Marc Gregoire, tried putting Teflon on hisfishing gear to prevent tangles. But then his wife saw him doing that, and her reaction was that,\"This is absolute nonsense. No one is ever gonna use this. You should do something thatsomeone's actually gonna use. So how about you put it on apan? Make a pan non-stick.\" And once these pans hit the market, it was a cooking revolution. Teflon.- Teflon. Teflon. And DuPont knewexactly how to market it. Even oatmeal won't stick to Teflon. Hey, neat. Let me try. And it wasn't just non-stick pans. Teflon, C8, and chemicals likeit were used in everything. Slip-Away contains themagic of DuPont's Teflon. Suddenly, we had Teflonstain-resistant carpets and stain protection sprayslike 3M's Scotchgard. Jackets lined with Teflon werewaterproof and breathable. Gore-Tex is the brand name. Teflon was so inert thatmedical implants made out of it wouldn't be rejected by the body. It was used to coat the Statueof Liberty's steel framework to save it from corrosion. And even bullets were coated with Teflon to minimize the damage they did coming out of the gun barrel. The term Teflon was so ubiquitous that when the Italian mobster John Gotti was being prosecuted in the late 1980s, none of the chargesagainst him would stick. So he was dubbed Teflon Don. By the late 1990s, the Teflon business generatedroughly a billion dollars in yearly sales for DuPont. Teflon has a great future,and its uses will be many. The chemicals were everywhere, even where they shouldn't be. He suspected thatsomething in this creek was poisoning his cows. Earl was desperate.So he hired a lawyer. He came to our offices armed with boxes of VHS videotapes. We started watching these videotapes, and you know, there wasa serious problem here. The animals were wasting away, and they were skin and bones, and they had tumors and black teeth. And you could see, on the videotape, white foam coming out of the pipe on this landfill next door with these animalsstanding in the white foam. The hair on their hooveswas being eaten off by whatever was in the water. It was a discharge pipe, and it had the marking of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. And the landfill that pipewas draining from belonged to DuPont's massive factory complex outside of Parkersburg, WestVirginia, just six miles away. That factory was Washington Works, the first commercial Teflon plant. It provided jobs for almost2,000 people in the town. And DuPont's presence was felt everywhere. I have been a resident ofParkersburg for 48 years. I do not work for the DuPont company, but I have seen how theirpeople have done much for the cultural growth of this community. There are facilities fortennis, camping, swimming, softball, and more than 20areas equipped for cookouts and family picnics. DuPont took care of the community. So when the town folk got word that Earl Tennant hireda lawyer to investigate, they shunned him and his family. As his sister-in-law put it,we'd walk into a restaurant and everybody in the restaurantwould get up and leave. But Earl wasn't scaredoff, and neither was Rob. I thought this was gonnabe pretty straightforward. See, the US EnvironmentalProtection Agency, the EPA, dictates exactly which chemicals are safe to be disposed of in alandfill and in what amounts. We would get those records and permits, and it would tell us which chemical was causing this problem. But none of those recordswere really showing anything that was really causing a problem, you know, nothing that wouldexplain that white foam. Whatever was in Earl'swater wasn't on the permits. Now, already in the 1950s,people knew that Teflon, specifically PTFE, was pretty safe. It's a long and extremely inert molecule. So if you ingest it, yourbody just flushes it out. However, if you heat Teflonto 350 degrees Celsius, it starts releasing fumesthat make people sick. This often happened toworkers in Teflon plants. Stray PTFE powder wouldfall onto their cigarettes as they were working, and then later they wouldaccidentally smoke one of these cigarettes. Luckily, the symptoms were mild: fatigue, tightness of chest, headaches, and they would usuallypass within 48 hours. It was called polymer fume fever. And even though it rarely happens today, it's why you should neveroverheat your Teflon pan to these temperatures, especially if you have pet birds at home, because the fumes aremuch more toxic to them. But Teflon couldn't havepoisoned Earl's cows. There were no fumes or high temperatures, so there must have beensomething else in the water. Rob filed a legal request for all of the WashingtonWorks operational records, and DuPont sent them over, more than 60,000 documents. A lot of folks would try to say, \"Okay, you you want a lot of documents, we'll give you a of documents\" and hope that there'd be no waysomebody could actually wade through all of these filesand all of these materials. But I am the kind ofperson that I do dig in, and I do want to gothrough those documents, so I actually did read all of that. And in those files, a certain chemical keptpopping up everywhere, C8. I never saw the kindsof things I was seeing now in these documents from DuPont. (foreboding music) In 1961, the same yearTeflon pans hit the US market, DuPont's in-house scientiststested C8 on rats. Ingesting as little as 1.5 milligrams of C8 per kilogram of bodyweight caused the rat's livers to grow abnormally. And a dose of 570 milligramsper kilogram was lethal. For reference, sodium cyanide, one of the most dangerouspoisons, is lethal to rats in doses of five to 15milligrams per kilogram. But even though C8 was less fatal, it was concerning for two other reasons. First, like Teflon, its tail is made of carbon-fluorine bonds, which makes it incredibly stable. So C8 wouldn't break down inthe environment for decades. And second, C8 looks like the fatty acids that humans and animalsneed for normal functioning, just with fluorines instead of hydrogens. So the concern was that C8could get into the bloodstream, hitch a ride on the proteins that transport fatty acids around, and get almost anywhere in the body. And because of the carbon-fluorine bonds, humans and animals haveno way to break down C8, so it could slowly build up,mimicking those fatty acids and potentially disruptingthe systems they regulate, like the liver. Toxic, persistent, bioaccumulative. So the concern was it'slike a ticking time bomb. It's got more opportunity to cause harm. As a safety measure, thatsame rat study suggested that all these materials shouldbe handled with extreme care and that contact with skinshould be strictly avoided. In 1962, DuPont redid the study and confirmed that highdoses of C8 kill rats through injury to the stomach, intestine, brain, lungs, and pancreas. Then in 1965, they found thosesame toxic effects in dogs. The evidence was mounting. (suspenseful music)(camera clicks) They were even studying monkeys. Some of the monkeys were dropping dead. These chemicals were causing toxic effects in multiple organ systemsin multiple species. All these studies weren't being shared with the scientific community. And likely no one outside of DuPont would've noticedsomething was wrong if it was not for... Tooth decay, the mostwidespread of all diseases. In the 1950s, tooth decaywas a nationwide problem. So the US started addinginorganic fluorides like sodium fluoride tothe public water supply. This helped fight cavities. 16 years after fluoridation, all children will have65% less tooth decay. In 1975, researchers wanted to know if that inorganic fluoride wasgetting into people's blood. So they sampled blood from around the US, and the results were as expected. More fluoride in the tapwater meant more fluoride in the blood. But they found another typeof fluorine in the blood too, which was organic fluorine, carbon-fluorine bonds, and itdidn't follow the same trend. Well, these researchers were wondering, where's this coming from? Because this is not anaturally occurring substance. And they did research, and they found that 3M wasmaking these organic fluorides, things like PFOA. All right, so they approached3M in 1975, asking them, \"Hey, we found this stuff in the general US population's blood. You know, could it be yours?\" And 3M pled ignorance. But just three months later, 3M compared the spectrum oforganic fluorine from the study to their own chemicals, and it was a match. Their chemicals weregetting into the blood of people all across the United States, but they didn't tell the researchers. 3M and DuPont were worried, so they checked their own workers' blood, and they found that they toowere contaminated with C8 at levels 1,000 times higherthan those in the study. And when DuPont checkedtheir medical records, many of these workers wereshowing signs of liver disease. Meanwhile, DuPont wasdumping almost 10 tons of C8 into the Ohio River each year, and they were pilingup thousands more tons as C8 sludge that would leach from the landfill next to Earl's farm, all while showing commercials like these. And the water thateventually flows to the river is collected at five points and analyzed to make sure we don't pollute the Ohio. And by the early '80s, the first cancer study is done in rats, and it confirms PFOA causes, not just might be linked with, but causes testicular tumors, all right? That sends alarm bellsoff within the company because the concern is, of course, we're putting this in the air,we're putting in the water. It's in Teflon. DuPont collected samplesaround Washington Works, and C8 wasn't just in the river, it was in the public water supply. So in 1984, DuPont officials met to assess whether C8 should be swapped for a safer chemical. But their conclusionwas that currently none of the options developed are, from a fine powder business standpoint, economically attractive,so C8 stuck around, and DuPont just came up with asafe dose for drinking water. DuPont scientists are thefirst people on the planet to say what would be asafe level for humans. They calculated somethinglike 0.6 parts per billion, which they rounded up to one. And the importance ofthat is, at that time, that was about the lowest levelyou could detect in water. Essentially, if we candetect it, it's too high. So to put that into perspective, here is one 2,500-liter tank of water. It filled to the brim. Now, imagine you take one dropof PFOA, 0.05 milliliters, and you place it not in one of these tanks or two or three, 20 of these tanks. That's one part per billion, and that's the number DuPont thought would be unsafe for humans to drink. And after determiningits own safety metric, DuPont tested the landfillwastewater leaching into Earl's creek. It came back at 1,600 parts per billion. They didn't tell anybody. So at that point, Ithought I had figured out what had finally happened to the cows. Rob compiled all theevidence into a 900-page letter and sent it to the EPA,the Department of Justice, and even the US Attorney General. And just a few months later, DuPont settled with Earl Tennant and his family for an undisclosed sum, although they didn'tadmit to any wrongdoing. But this stuff wasn't just in the water the cows were drinking. This was in the surrounding communities'public wells, right? People around Mr. Tennant, the tens of thousands of people in that community hadlikely been drinking this for decades and didn't know. So Rob sued DuPont again, now on behalf of the 70,000people around Parkersburg who were unwittingly exposed to C8. And it wasn't justParkersburg or West Virginia. In the year 2000, researchersanalyzed blood samples from thousands of Americansall across the country, and 100% of those samplescame back positive for C8 at an average of five parts per billion. But if virtually everyonein the US is contaminated, how harmful could C8 really be? This is exactly what Rob had to find out to have a fighting chance against DuPont. So in 2005, he spearheaded a medical study of everyone around Washington Works. Scientists need to know if the chemical C8 causesany health problems. By completing a health questionnaire and having your bloodtested, you can help. Analyzing the blood samples and medical records took seven long years, and many in Parkersburg passed away before a verdict was even reached, including Earl and his wife Sandra. But finally, in 2013, an independent sciencepanel had the results. They confirmed a probable link between C8 and six human diseases,including thyroid disease, testicular cancer, and kidney cancer. And these findings were basedsolely on the nearby community with an average C8 bloodlevel of 28 parts per billion. So for example, an Americanmale has around a 1 in 43 chance of developing kidney cancer. It's around 1 in 73 for females, but a person with morethan 30 parts per billion of C8 in their blood serum might have about double the odds, so roughly 1 in 22 for malesand 1 in 37 for females. But the data in many of these studies only included survivors, not people who might havealready died from C8 exposure. So the verdict was that the findings must beinterpreted with caution. The true risk of C8 might be even higher. Luckily, once these studieswere published in 2013, DuPont was pressured by theregulators to phase out C8. And by 2017, they had topay out over $600 million to victims of C8 exposure, which is a pretty small price to pay for a company that made almost $80 billion in sales just that year. And all throughout, DuPontdenied any wrongdoing, but that wasn't the end of itfor Parkersburg or anyone else because DuPont separatedits entire Teflon business into a spinoff company, Chemours, that agreed to use a different chemical. So what was it? They simply took C8 andknocked two carbons off and started making C6. They called it GenX. Because it was shorter and had an oxygen atominterrupting the carbon chain, it was expected to be more degradable. So Chemours claimed a dose ashigh as 70 parts per billion of GenX in drinking waterwould still be safe. That chemical gets shipped to the same plant in West Virginia. So now GenX goes into the air. GenX goes into the Ohio River. GenX is found in public water supplies. So GenX is allowed tocome out into the world, be used in Teflon. Then the cancer study is done, which shows GenX causesthe exact same three tumors in rats that PFOA did: liver, testicular, and pancreatic. And the fact that its chain is shorter also makes GenX more mobile, so it could contaminate larger areas. The truth is we just don'tknow enough about it, and that's exactly the problem. It took us decades to get to the point of finally addressing C8. They simply tweak it a bit,change the chemical name. All of the science and allof the concern, that's on C8. This is C6 or C9 or C4. You don't have enough evidence that these other ones are bad. This is Whac-A-Mole. We get to the point we're addressing one and the new one pops up and we're told we have to start over. And it isn't just C8 or GenX. They belong to a family of over 14,000 differentmanmade chemicals, all covered in carbon-fluorine bonds. And companies can makethem however they want, C7s, C9s, branched, polymers, acids. The generic term for all ofthese substances is PFAS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and like Teflon, they havealmost magical qualities. They repel liquids, so PFAS are used to makeclothing waterproof. They're also grease-resistant, so we coat things like fast food wrappers and microwave popcorn bagsin PFAS to prevent stains. Waterproof lipstick andmascara, hygiene products, and even contact lenses have PFAS in. Even the screen you're watching this on, likely has a PFAS anti-smudge coating. (brooding music) The trouble is that thesame carbon-fluorine bonds that make PFAS so stable and useful in consumer products also make them incrediblypersistent in the environment. Which is why you might also know PFAS under a different name, forever chemicals. They have been foundeverywhere from bustling cities to untouched areas of wilderness. Every continent, includingAntarctica, has PFAS all over it. Almost every living creature from polar bears to birds to fish, I mean, this stuff isbeing found everywhere. So massive worldwide contamination, but by completely manmade chemicals that are fingerprints back tojust a couple of companies. Even though companies knew how dangerous thesechemicals were 50 years ago, they decided not to informthe public and the regulators. So we're only finding out about this global contamination now. And there've been many cases where important public health information doesn't get widely disseminated for years. And whenever that happens, media coverage can be inconsistent, which is why I've partneredup with Ground News as the sponsor of this video. Their platform reveals howstories like these are covered across the media landscape. For example, a recent study suggested that 23 million Americans were exposed to foreverchemicals through wastewater, but you probably haven't seen the story since fewer than 40outlets even published it. And take a look at how different some of these headlines are. With Ground News, you can also see thatgovernment-funded sources had limited reporting of this story, and only 9% of the publicationswere right-leaning. So Ground News flagged thisas a potential blind spot. It's highlighted on their blind-spot feed where you can see stories that are disproportionately covered by one side of the political spectrum. The whole point ofVeritasium is to make videos that get to the truth, whether that's explaining misconceptions or getting to the bottom ofpotentially dangerous chemicals. Ground News helps us do that,and they can help you too. So if you, like us, careabout getting to the truth, go to ground.news/ve or scan this QR code. Our link gets you 40%off their vantage plan. And now back to PFAS. (quirky music) Okay, now I wanna find out how much of these chemicals isactually in my blood. So I have a little test here. (groans) I hate the idea of drawingmy own blood. (groans) Okay, that was pretty easy, actually. I was really worried that there was not gonnabe enough blood coming out. But there was plenty. (sighs) So the question is, how much of these dangerouschemicals are in my blood? Has anyone ever come back with blood that has zero PFAS whatsoever? I've been doing bloodtesting on PFAS since 2007, and I've never seen a non-detect. No way.- So I hear that 98% of the population has PFAS in their blood, but I'm looking for that 2% that doesn't because I've yet to see them. That's incredible, I mean very, very bad incredible, but wow. But if everyone onEarth has trace amounts of these chemicals in their blood, how much harm could they really be doing? I wanna make a distinction because it turns out not allPFAS are equally dangerous. You can kind of splitthem up into two groups. First up, you have long, repeating chains of carbon-fluorine bonds that are tens or hundredsof thousands of atoms long, so stuff like Teflon. These are so big and inert thateven if you do ingest them, your body's just gonna flush them out. They can't be absorbedinto your bloodstream, so you're pretty safe. They're called fluoropolymers because of the long repeating chains of carbon and fluorine bonds. But the catch is to makethese fluoropolymers, stuff like Teflon, you needto use processing aids, things like PFOA or GenX,and those are the nasty ones. These molecules are 5 to 10 carbons long, which makes them small enough to actually enter the bloodstream. They have functional groups at the ends that are usually acids. The most common ones areperfluoroalkyl acids, which means that they can bindto the proteins in your blood and be transported anywhere in the body. So they slowly accumulateand build up over time. Now, there are more thanjust two groups of PFAS and even different definitionsof what PFAS even are, but most of what we know really relates to just a handful of chemicalsfrom this group here, to these perfluoroalkyl acids. (wondrous music) Perhaps the most comprehensivedocument on PFAS toxicity was published in 2022 by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. And it looked at onlyseven perfluoroalkyl acids. These are sister chemicals to PFOA. And some of them, like PFOS and PFHxS, were used heavily inthe production of stain and water-resistant productslike 3M's Scotchgard before they too got phasedout due to toxicity concerns. The report surmised that if the sum of these seven acids in your blood is below two parts per billion,there shouldn't be any harm. If your level is between 2and 20 parts per billion, there's a potential forharmful health effects. Although the exact mechanism by which PFAS cause harmisn't fully understood, exposure has mostconsistently been associated with high cholesterol, adecreased immune system response to vaccines and infections, kidney cancer, and decreased growth in infants. But PFAS have also been linked to dozens of other conditions, and above 20 parts per billion,the risk is even greater. So where do I fall on this graph? Right, so I have your results here. You're not gonna tell me what yours were before I see mine? No. All right. You're positive for PFOA. Okay. The level for PFOA fora US person went down from five parts perbillion around the 2000s to around 1.46, what you have. So you're super average for a US person. Great. Okay. The good news is though,no GenX for you or for me, which is great. All right, let's go. But the real surprise, I ,guess is PFOS, the sister chemical, and itwas used in a similar way, so stain-resistantcarpets, treated clothing, and your result is at8.93 parts per billion, whereas the US average is 4.3. -Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah, it is crazy 'cause it was discontinuedpretty much in 2002. This is not the results I expected. I honestly expected very boring results of, like, yeah, you'rearound the middle of the pack or a little bit on the low side. And then for PFHxS, basically PFOS but sixinstead of eight carbons, your levels here are almostseven parts per billion, but the US average averageis one part per billion. You're higher than 95% of Americans. It just, like, it shocks me 'cause, like, I was fully walking into this meeting expecting to be, you know, roughly average. Yeah, to me, it's scary. You know, you live ina normal life thinking that you're taking care of everything, and then you have high levels of a chemical you never heard of. The combined sum of allthe PAS detected in my blood was 17.92 parts per billion, more than double the US median. I'm just below the level where the National Academiesrecommend additional screenings for PFAS-related diseases. I had no idea I would comeback with such elevated levels. I'd love to get thelevel, sort of, down a bit to a level where I feellike it's more in line with the general population. Yeah. But, like, where couldthis have come from? There are three main ways we get exposed to forever chemicals, and the one you'll hearthe most about in the media is likely PFAS-containing products. Shampoo, dental floss,paints, varnishes. Potentially dangerous chemicals. Dangerous chemicals, toxic chemicals. People are throwing outtheir non-stick cookware. My wife threw out all ournon-stick pans over a year ago, and since then, we've beenusing stainless steel. She is very good at making itnot stick. Me, not so much. But are pans really the problem? The actual coating on the pan is Teflon, which, again, is just a long, inert chain of carbon-fluorine bonds. So even if you ingest it, itdoesn't react with your body. If you have a pan like that at home, you probably don't need to throw it out. The same goes for most otherPFAS-containing products. Waterproof clothing,stain-resistant furniture, and sweat-proof watchbands might all release some level of PFAS, but the risk of direct exposurethrough skin is likely low. So the bigger problem is how easily PFAS from these products canend up in the environment. And many of the factories that make these productsdon't have a good track record of keeping the chemicals contained. People don't understandthat the stories that you see, for example, what was happening in the community in West Virginia, this is the same chemicaland the same things that we're seeing playout now in Australia and in Japan, in Italy,in Germany, in the UK. I mean, there are a lot of folks that are still not grasping the fact that these are the same chemicals. Our second main sourceof exposure is food. A lot of it comes packagedin PFAS-treated materials, like takeout boxes,microwave popcorn bags, and burger wrappers. It's on a burger wrapper. Is it a tiny amount? Is ita ridiculously tiny amount? We actually did tests at the lab with stuff that usually contains PFAS. So microwave popcorn, fast food wrappers, paper cups that are waterproof. So I have tap water herefrom a house in London. Could we boil some water? Because usually youinteract with these products when they're hot and then seeif any of the PFAS leaches off and you potentiallyeat them or drink them. This is citizen science, right? So it's, like, there might be some error, but with a solid control and then with the same tapwater going to all of them, we can at least get something, yeah. Yeah, and even if we get nothing, we'll know that people are probably safe using these products. All right.- Whisk it around. Yeah, really get that PFAS in that water, right.- The juices going. And get the PFAS juices going.- Well, it's supposed to be safe for human consumption. Yeah.- That's the wild thing. We sloshed it around there, hot water, boiling waterfor around 30 seconds, and then we tested that waterto see if any of the PFAS that are used to coat these items would actually make it into the water. So here's what I got. And these are parts per trillion now. So for PFOA, good news. Basically no detection anywhere except for the microwave popcorn. I will say these are very lowlevels, but hold your horses 'cause microwave popcorn gets worse. The thing about microwave popcorn, it's sitting in therewrapped up with the popcorn for months or years before you ever stickit in your microwave. That gives those chemicals plenty of time to, like, leach into the oils, and it's gonna go all over the popcorn, and you're gonna eat it. This could explain someof our own results. The level for PFPeA, which is a shorter variation of PFOA, came back at 10 parts per trillion after the popcorn bag test. And you can see similar results in some of the other PFAS species. But then microwave popcornactually drops for PFOS. Why could that be? We don't actually know. I was gonna say maybe the PFOS, like, went on that wrapper and found its friends and just hung out there. Yeah, could be. I know we've only done,like, one test here. No repeat measurements, so wecan't conclude much from this, but there's something to be said for when you're using these products, they're gonna leach into yourwater and leach into your food And research tends to agree. A 2019 study found that eating fast food and microwave popcorn especiallycan increase your PFAS load while eating homecooked meals doesn't. But even something as simpleas reheating your food on a plate instead of inthe original packaging could prevent PFAS frommigrating to your food. Now, you might expect that these part pertrillion levels we detected in the London tap waterare nothing compared to the parts per billionyou'd find in human blood, but the surprising thing is that to have two parts per billionof PFOA in your blood, you don't need to drink water with two parts per billion of PFOA in it because PFAS accumulatein your body over time. So even water with as littleas four parts per trillion of PFOA combined with otherexposure can be enough to maintain your blood levels this high. And this is why, in addition to food, water is your biggest source of exposure. This is especially true ifyou live near a PFAS factory where the local water isoften heavily contaminated. But the same goes for areasnear military bases or airports. See, adding chemicals like PFOA or PFOS to water lowersits surface tension so the water gets more slippery, and these chemicals also tend to foam up. So they make for an excellent ingredient in firefighting foams,they spread quicker, and the foam blocks accessto oxygen extremely well. And since both military bases and airports frequently dofire drills with these foams, they end up seeping into the surrounding soil and groundwater. But it doesn't stop there. Currently, we have reachedplanetary saturation levels for PFAS, which means thatwhen you look up at that cloud and it rains, it rains unsafe levels of at least four PFAS species. It turns out that our entire water cycle is contaminated with PFAS. So even when it rainson the Tibetan Plateau, that rain contains PFAS. To check the water levels in your area, you can use these maps that show PFAScontamination across the US, Europe, and Australia. What about Los Angeles, Encino? That's where I spent, like,7 of the last 10 years. Crescenta Valley. Those are all high. Yeah. Santa Clarita, some.PFHxS level is crazy. So maybe you're getting yourwater from Santa Clarita. Wow. There's a calculator. It could give you what anestimate in your blood serum is. What we can try to do now isput that up in the calculator, see if you get something close to what you have, if you want. Sure. PFHxS, so typical value for an adult is one part per billion, and then the Santa Clarita water is around 37 parts per trillion. If you look after, like, 10 years. So after roughly 10 years of exposure, you would have to have 6.85parts per billion in your blood. And then I can tell youthat you are at 6.84. That would explain things. Now, I can't say for sure where my drinking water was coming from, but if I was consistentlydrinking water contaminated at similar levels, then thatwould explain my results. But if you are worriedabout your own water, you should contact your provider directly for the most relevant information. It's concerning just how unregulated drinking water has been. It was actually only ayear ago in April 2024 that the US EPA finally set legal limits for PFAS in drinking water. The safe level for PFOA went down from DuPont's initial one part per billion to four parts per trillion. So we're no longer talkingabout one drop of PFOA in 20 of these tanks, we're talking about one drop in 5,000. That's five Olympic-sized swimming pools. And if there's even adrop of PFOA in there, the EPA is concerned. The same four parts per trillion limit was also set for PFOS,the sister chemical. And GenX went down from the 70,000 parts pertrillion initially proposed by Chemours to just 10. The same goes for PFHxS. For reference, the EPA'slimit for lead in water is 10,000 parts per trillion, and for cyanide, 200,000, It gives you a pretty clear indication of how concerned thescientific community is. And just when we got EPA limits, we got a new administration in the US, which might be reversingsome of the PFAS bans. So you can't alwaysdepend on the regulators, and you seemingly can'tdepend on the companies that make this stuff todispose of it safely. So what can you do? If your water is contaminated, you might want to considergetting a PFAS-certified filter. Reverse osmosis, granulated active carbon, and ion exchange filters are all capable of removing PFAS out of drinking water. But the responsibilityto filter drinking water shouldn't come down to the individual. PFAS should be captured at thesource, during manufacturing, before they ever reach the environment. And some companies like Puraffinity are developing customfilters to make that happen. So very lab-looking lab. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. So could you walk me through, like, what all these pipes do, andwhat do you have in here? So this water is representative of where you've had a bigfirefighting foam incident. So you wanna filter this water, but basically, the conceptis take it from the top through the vessel. As it passes through this material, it basically sticks on to some of the PFAS chemicals in water, and then you run intoanother part of treatment and a third one. To me, it seems like if PFASare so, like, bioaccumulative and actually persistent and stable, they don't really react with things. So how do you force them toreact with stuff in here? Basically, taking advantageof this long organic tail as well as the polar head, and so you can have someelectrostatic interactions with the polar head, and then you can have some hydrophilic and hydrophobicinteractions with the tail. And by combining thesethree binding mechanisms, you increase massively yourlikelihood of binding PFAS, even if it's still difficult. Right, do the levelsdrop 100% already here, or do you see a gradual decrease in PFAS as you go?- That's the cool question. Okay.- So in the beginning, it drops 100% after this one. Oh, so problem solved, or? Problem solved for the time being. Okay. Okay.- What we see right now is it will last about 40,000volumes of this vessel. So a 10-liter vessel wouldbasically provides all of the PFAS treatment for a household. In a year.- For a year. You want this to be in factories first, so it never gets into the water. Yeah.- Yeah. We are talking to thefluorochemicals manufacturers, and they're really trying to, yeah, move forward rather thanjust wait for regulations. (bright music) Everyone's true risk fromPFAS will be different. It depends on dozens of factors, like your watercontamination, your lifestyle, what you eat. But how much should youreally worry about it? Like, if I'm at 17 or18 parts per billion, is that the equivalent ofdrinking a beer a night or going out in the Australiansun without sunscreen? So what I like to do iscreate this hierarchy of risk. And in terms of hierarchyof risk reduction, number one on that isstopping smoking, exercising, consuming a healthy, whole-food diet, and making sure you're gettingseven to nine hours of sleep. Then you have mediumlevels of intervention, seeing your primary care doctor, controlling your cholesterol numbers. And then on the lower tier that you have, PFAS probably falls into that lower tier. Being preventative about PFAS exposure is currently our only option because there are no approvedmedical treatments available. However, if you compare PFAS contamination between the sexes, male levelsare consistently higher, at least up until around the age of 50 when menopause usually starts. This is partly becausemenstruation, birth, and lactation are all waysPFAS can escape the body. PFAS can pass through the placenta and into the fetus during pregnancy, and then the baby can also getexposed through breast milk. It's something that pregnant people should be extremely careful about. You know, young childrenare incredibly susceptible. They're drinking morewater, they're growing, they're near surfaceslike treated carpets. Now, not everyone hasto change their lifestyle because of PFAS, but if youare in a high-risk group because of pregnancy or because you live or workin a PFAS-contaminated area, you might want to consider it. (fire roaring) Firefighters haveespecially high PFAS levels because their gear andfoams are laced with them. Remarkably, a 2022 study found that when firefighters donated blood or plasma frequently enough, they reduced their PFAS levelsby up to 30% within a year. And it's kind of ironic that, you know, our health system'scoming back to bloodletting. What do you think aboutthe idea of donating blood as a way to reduce PFAS in the body? I've never heard of that as a strategy. That's kind of interesting. Well, I definitely recommend people donate blood more frequently, not because of PFAS exposure, but because of the factwe desperately need blood. What's important to note is that, especially in this current administration, we need to be very carefulabout shifting budgets away from research agenciesbecause without that research, the guidance that I'm giving is gonna be significantly more flawed. The reason I'm able totalk about what we know and what we don't knowcomes from that research. So if we're gonna be cutting the budgets to these major agenciesand letting scientists go, we're only gonna get worseand worse information. We are still a good few years away from proper medical treatmentand better PFAS regulations because this is extremely tricky. There are places where weshould ban PFAS completely, like hygiene products,cosmetics, and food packaging, and some countries are already doing that. But we also can't ban PFASaltogether, at least not yet, because we still rely on these chemicals for things like medical implants. And it's currently impossibleto make semiconductors for our electronics without them All the tubing for the vaccinemanufacturing is PFAS-based. They take us to space aswell, our space suits. But even in these niche applications, we have to be responsiblearound how we use it. People are coming together from a lot of different disciplines to create destruction mechanisms, to create novel capture materials, and to create novel replacements. I am excited and inspiredby all of the great work that's going on around me. So I think if people want to learn more, I would advise them tolearn about the risk, but then also learnabout the new technology that's being developed that will hopefully putus in the right direction. So to me, you know, one of the mostimportant things we can do is have discussions likewhat we're doing right here. If the story and theinformation's out there, people can make informed choices about whether they want tocontinue purchasing things that have these materials in them. And what we're seeing isconsumers, as they do become aware, are saying, \"No, we don'twant these chemicals.\" And companies arevoluntarily coming forward and taking these chemicals out of products because the consumersare now demanding it. We've been here beforewith lead in gasoline, Freon, and asbestos. And each time, we did the research and made the right decisionto phase these chemicals out. With PFAS, we're just startingto understand the problem. But I'm hopeful we'll makethe same decision again. If you want to informyourself more about PFAS, we've attached all the sources we've used to make this video downin the description. It's actually our longest episode ever, and we couldn't have made it without the help of oursponsor, Ground News. So if you wanna be more informed about the issues around theworld that are affecting you and everyone else out there, go to ground.news/ve or use this QR code.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: invention of the blue LED"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And you can see that becausehere is a transparent LED that also glows the same red color. The color of the light comes from the electronics themselves. The casing just helps ustell different LEDs apart. In 1962, general Electricengineer Nick Holonyak created the first visible LED. It glowed a faint red. A few years after that,engineers at Monsanto created a green LED. But for decades, all wehad were those two colors. So LEDs could only be usedin things like indicators, calculators, and watches. If only we could makeblue, then we could mix red, green, and blue to make white, and every other color, unlocking LEDs for every typeof lighting in the world, from light bulbs, to phones, to computers, to TVs to billboards. But blue was almost impossible to make. (dramatic music) Throughout the 1960s, every big electronicscompany in the world, from IBM to GE, to Bell Labs, raced to create the blue LED. They knew it would be worth billions. Despite the efforts ofthousands of researchers, nothing worked. 10 years after Holonyak's original LED turned into 20, then 30, and the hope of ever usingLEDs for light, faded away. According to a director at Monsanto, these won't ever replacethe kitchen light. They'd only be used inappliances, car dashboards, and stereo sets to seeif the stereo was on. This might still be truetoday, if not for one engineer who defied the entire industry and made three radical breakthroughs to create the world's first blue LED. (dramatic music) Sh\u016bji Nakamura was a researcherat a small Japanese chemical company named Nichia. They had recently expandedinto the production of semiconductors to beused in the manufacture of red and green LEDs. But by the late 1980s, the semiconductor divisionwas on its last legs. They were competing againstfar more established companies in a crowdedmarket, and they were losing. Tensions started to run high. Younger employees beggedNakamura to create new products, while senior workers calledhis research a waste of money. And at Nichia, money was in short supply. Nakamura's lab mainlyconsisted of machinery he had scavenged andwelded together himself. Phosphorus leaks in his labcreated so many explosions, that his coworkers hadstopped checking in on him. By 1988, Nakamura's supervisorswere so disillusioned with his research thatthey told him to quit. So it was out of desperation that he brought a radicalproposal to the company's founder and president Nobuo Ogawa. (dramatic music) The elusive blue LED, that the likes of of Sony,Toshiba and Panasonic had all failed at. What if Nichia could bethe one to create it? After suffering loss afterloss on their semiconductors for more than a decade, Ogawa took a gamble. He devoted 500 million yen or $3 million, likely around 15% of thecompany's annual profit, to Nakamura's moonshot Project. Everyone knew that LEDs have the potential to replace light bulbs, because light bulbs, the universalsymbol for a bright idea, are actually terrible at making light. They work by running currentthrough a tungsten filament, which gets so hot, it glows. But most of the electromagnetic radiation comes out as infrared, heat. Only a negligiblefraction is visible light. In contrast, LED standsfor light emitting diode. It's right there in the name. LEDs primarily create light,so they're far more efficient, and a diode is just adevice with two electrodes, which only allows currentto flow in one direction. So here's how an LED works. When you have an isolated atom, each electron in that atomoccupies a discreet energy level. You can think of these energylevels like individual seats from a hockey stadium, and all atoms of the same element, when they are far apart from each other have identical available energy levels. But when you bring multipleatoms together to form a solid, something interesting happens. The outermost electrons now feel the pole, not only of their own nucleus, but of all the other nuclei as well. And as a result, theirenergy levels shift. So instead of being identical, they become a series of closely spaced, but separate energy levels. An energy band. The highest energy bandwith electrons in it, is known as the valence band, and the next higher energy band is called the conduction band. You can think of itlike the balcony level. In conductors, the valenceband is only partially filled. This means with a littlebit of thermal energy, electrons can jump intonearby unfilled seats, and if an electric field is applied, they can jump from oneunfilled seat to the next and conduct current through the material. In insulators, the valence band is full, and the difference inenergy between the valence and conduction bands,the band gap, is large. So when an electric field isapplied, no electrons can move. There are no available seats to move into in the valence band, and the band gap is toobig for any electrons to jump into the conduction band, which brings us to semiconductors. Semiconductors are similar to insulators, except the band gap is much smaller. This means at room temperature, a few electrons willhave sufficient energy to jump into the conduction band, and now they can easilyaccess nearby empty seats and conduct current. Not only that, the empty seats they left behind in the valence band can also move. Well, really, it's the nearby electrons jumping into those empty seats. But if you look from afar, it's as though the empty seat or hole is moving like a positivecharge in the opposite direction to the electronsin the conduction band. (soft music) By themselves, pure semiconductorsare not that useful. To make them way more functional, you have to add impurityatoms into the lattice. This is known as doping. For example, in silicon, you can add a small numberof phosphorus atoms. Phosphorus is similar to silicon, so it easily fits into the lattice, but it brings with it oneextra valence electron. This electron exists in a donor level just beneath the conduction band. So with a bit of thermal energy, all these electrons can jumpinto the conduction band and conduct current. Since most of the charges that can move in this type ofsemiconductor are electrons, which are negative, this sort of semiconductoris called n-type, n for negative, but I should point outthat the semiconductor itself is still neutral. It's just that most of the mobile charge carriers are negative. They're electrons. So there is also another typeof semiconductor where most of the mobile chargecarriers are positive, and it's called p-type. To make p-type silicon, you add a small numberof atoms of, say, boron. Boron fits into the lattice, but brings with it one fewervalence electron than silicon. So it creates an empty acceptor level just above the valence band. And with a bit of thermal energy, electrons can jump outta the valence band, leaving behind holes. It is these positive holeswhich are mostly responsible for carrying current inthe p-type semiconductor. Again, the material overall is uncharged, it's just that most ofthe mobile charge carriers are positive holes. Where things get interestingis when you put a piece of p-type and n-type together. Without even connecting this to a circuit, some electrons will diffuse from n to p and fall into the holes in the p-type. This makes the p-type alittle negatively charged, and the n-type a littlepositively charged. So there is now an electric field inside an inert piece of material. Electrons keep diffusing until the electric field becomes so large, it prevents them from crossing over. And now we have establishedthe depletion region, an area depleted ofmobile charge carriers. There are no electronsin the conduction band and no holes in the valence band. If you connect a batterythe wrong way to this diode, it simply expands the depletion region until its electric fieldperfectly opposes that of the battery and no current flows. But if you flip thepolarity of the battery, then the depletion region shrinks, the electric field decreases, and electrons can flow from n to p. When an electron falls fromthe conduction band into a hole in the valence band, thatband gap energy can be emitted as a photon. The energy change of theelectron is emitted as light, and this is how a lightemitting diode works. The size of the bandgap determines the color of the light emitted. In pure silicon, the band gapis only 1.1 electron volts. So the photon released isn'tvisible, it's infrared light. These LEDs are actuallyused in remote controls for your TV, and you cancapture them on camera. Moving up the spectrum, youcan see why the first visible light LEDs were red and then green, and why blue was so hard. A photon of blue lightrequires more energy, and therefore a larger band gap. By the 1980s, after hundreds of millions ofdollars had been spent hunting for the right material,every electronics company had come up empty handed. But researchers had at least figured out the first critical requirement,high quality crystal. No matter what materialyou used for the blue LED, it required a nearperfect crystal structure. Any defects in the crystal lattice, disrupt the flow of electrons. So instead of emitting theirenergy as visible light, it is instead dissipated as heat. So the first step inNakamura's proposal to Ogawa, was to disappear to Florida. He knew an old colleaguethere whose lab was beginning to use a new crystalmaking technology called Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition, or MOCVD. An MOCVD reactor,essentially a giant oven, was and still is the best wayto mass produce clean crystal. It works by injecting vapor molecules of your crystal into a hotchamber where they react with a base material calleda substrate to form layers. It's important that thesubstrate lattice matches the crystal latticebeing built on top of it to create a stable, smooth crystal. This is a precise art. The crystal layersoften need to be as thin as just a couple of atoms. Nakamura joined the labfor a year to master MOCVD. But his time there was miserable. He wasn't allowed touse the working MOCVD, so he spent 10 of his 12months assembling a new system, almost from scratch. Even worse, his lab mates shunned him because Nakamura didn't have a doctorate, nor any academic papers to his name, as Nichia didn't allow publishing. His lab mates, all PhD researchers, dismissed him as a lowly technician. This experience fueled him. Nakamura wrote, \"I feel resentful when people looked down on me. I developed more fighting spirit. I would not allow myself tobe beaten by such people.\" (inspirational music) He returned to Japan in 1989with two things in hand. One, an order for a brandnew MOCVD reactor for Nichia, and two, a fervent desire to get his PhD. At that time in Japan,you could earn a PhD without having to go to university, simply by publishing five papers. Nakamura had always known his chances of inventing the blue LED were low. But now he had a backup plan. Even if he didn't succeed, hecould at least get his PhD. But now the question waswith MOCVD under his belt, which material should he research? By this time, scientists hadnarrowed the options down to two main candidates, zincselenide, and gallium nitride. These were bothsemiconductors with band gaps, theoretically, in the blue light range. Zinc selenide was the farmore promising option. When grown in an MOCVD reactor, it had only a .3% lattice mismatch with its substrate, gallium arsenide. Therefore, zinc selenidecrystal had about a thousand defects per square centimeter, within the upper limitfor LED functioning. Its only issue was that while scientists had figured out multiple different ways to create n-type zinc selenide, no one knew how to create p-type. In contrast, galliumnitride had been abandoned by almost everybody for three reasons. First, it was much harder tomake a high quality crystal. The best substrate for growinggallium nitride was sapphire, but its lattice mismatch was 16%. This resulted in higher defects, over 10 billion per square centimeter. The second problem wasthat like zinc selenide, scientists had only ever created n-type gallium nitride using silicon. P-type was elusive. And third, to be commercially viable, a blue LED would have to havea total light output power of at least a thousand microwatts. That's two orders of magnitude more than anyprototype had ever achieved. So between the two candidates, almost all researchers werefocused on zinc selenide. Nakamura surveyed the crowded field and decided that if he were going to publish five papers by himself, he'd better focus on gallium nitride, where the competitionwas much less fierce. This material's main claim to fame was one development back in 1972, when RCA engineer HerbertMaruska made a tiny gallium nitride blue LED, butit was dim and inefficient. So RCA slashed the project'sbudget, calling it a dead end. 20 years later, scientificopinion hadn't changed. When Nakamura attended thebiggest applied physics conference in Japan, thetalks on zinc selenide had over 500 attendees. The talks on gallium nitride had five. (dramatic music) Two of those five attendeeswere the world experts on gallium nitride, Dr. Isamu Akasaki and his former gradstudent, Dr. Hiroshi Amano. In contrast to Nakamura'sacademic background, they were researchersat Nagoya University, one of Japan's best. A few years earlier, theyhad made a breakthrough on the first problem ofhigh quality crystal. Instead of growing galliumnitride directly on sapphire, they first grew a bufferlayer of aluminum nitride. This has a lattice spacing in between that of the other twomaterials, making it easier to grow a clean galliumnitride crystal on top. The only issue was that thealuminum caused problems for the MOCVD reactor, making the process hard to scale. But Nakamura wasn't evenclose at this stage. Back at Nichia, he couldn't getgallium nitride to even grow normally in his new MOCVD reactor. After six months, desperate for results, he decided to take the machine apart and build a better version himself. His 10 months spent puttingtogether the reactor in Florida, were suddenly invaluable. He began following thesame routine each day, arrive at the lab at 7:00 AM. Spend the first half of the day welding, cutting,and rewiring the reactor. Spend the rest of the day experimenting with the modified reactorto see what it can do. At 7:00 PM go home, eatdinner, wash and sleep. Nakamura repeated thisroutine every single day, taking no weekends and no holidays except for New Year's Day, the most important holiday in Japan. (soft music) After a year and a halfof continuous work, he came into the lab on awinter day in late 1990. As usual, he tinkeredaround in the morning grew a gallium nitridesample in the afternoon, and tested it. But this time, the electronmobility was four times higher than any gallium nitride evergrown directly on sapphire. Nakamura called it the mostexciting day of his life. His trick was to add a second nozzle to the MOCVD reactor. The gallium nitride reactantgases had been rising in the hot chamber, mixing in the air to form a powdery waste. But the second nozzlereleased a downward stream of inert gas, pinning thefirst flow to the substrate to form a uniform crystal. For years, scientists hadavoided adding a second stream to MOCVD because theythought it would only introduce more turbulence. But Nakamura used a special nozzle so that even when the streams combined, they remained laminar. He called his inventionthe two-flow reactor. Now, he was ready to takeon Akazaki and Amano, but instead of copying theiraluminum nitride buffer layer, his two flow design allowedhim to make gallium nitride so smooth and stable,it itself could be used as a buffer layer onthe sapphire substrate. This in turn, yieldedan even cleaner crystal of gallium nitride on top, without the issues of aluminum. Nakamura now had the highest quality gallium nitride crystals ever made. But just as he was getting started, things took a wrong turn. (dramatic music) While he had been in Florida, Nobuo Ogawa had stepped backfrom Nichia to become chairman. In his day, Nobuo had beena risk taking scientist, designing the company's first products. It's why he supported Nakamura'slofty plans all this time. But in his place, hisson-in-law, Eji Ogawa, became CEO of the company, and the younger Ogawa hada much stricter outlook. One Nichia client said, \"He has a mind of steel, and he remembers everything.\" In 1990, an executive at Matsushita, an LED manufacturer andNichia's biggest customer, visited the company togive a talk on blue LEDs. In it, he claimed zincselenide was the way forward, declaring \"gallium nitride has no future.\" That very same day, Nakamurareceived a note from Eji, stop work on gallium nitride immediately. Eji had never supported the research and wanted to end what hesaw as a colossal waste. But Nakamura crumpled upthe note and threw it away, and he did so again, and again, when a succession of similar notes and phone calls camefrom company management. Out of spite, he published hiswork on the two-flow reactor without Nichia's knowledge. It was his first paper. One down, four to go. With crystal formation settled, he turned to the second obstacle, creating p-type gallium nitride. Here Akazaki and Amano hadagain beaten him to the punch. They had created a galliumnitride sample doped with magnesium, but at first, it didn't perform as ap-type as they expected. However, after exposingit to an electron beam, it did behave as a p-type, the world's first p-type gallium nitride, after 20 years of trying. The catch was that noone knew why it worked. And the process ofirradiating each crystal with electrons was too slowfor commercial production. At first, Nakamura copiedAkazaki and Amano's approach, but he suspected the beamof electrons was overkill. Maybe all the crystal needed was energy. So he tried heating magnesiumdoped gallium nitride to 400 degrees Celsius in aprocess known as annealing. The result, a completely p-type sample. This worked even better thanthe shallow electron beam, which only made the surfacesof the samples p-type, and simply heating things upwas a quick scalable process. His work also revealed why thep-type had been so difficult. To make gallium nitride with MOCVD, you supplythe nitrogen from ammonia, but ammonia also contains hydrogen. Where there should havebeen holes in the magnesium doped gallium nitride, these hydrogen atoms were sneaking in and bonding with the magnesium,plugging all the holes. Adding energy to the system, released the hydrogen from the material, freeing up the holes again. (dramatic music) By now, Nakamura had all the ingredients to make a prototype blue LED, and he presented it at aworkshop in St. Louis in 1992 and received a standing ovation. He was beginning tomake a name for himself, but even though he had createdthe best prototype to date, it was more of a blue violet color and still extremely inefficient, with a light output power of just 42 microwatts, well below the 1000 microwattthreshold for practical use. At Nichia, the new CEO'spatience had run out. Eji sent written orders toNakamura to stop tinkering and turn whatever he had into a product. His job was on the line, but in Nakamura's own words,\"I kept ignoring his order. I had been successfulbecause I didn't listen to company orders andtrusted my own judgment.\" At this point, he onlyhad the third hurdle left, getting his blue LEDto a light output power of a thousand microwatts. (soft music) A known trick to increasethe efficiency of LEDs was to create a well, a thin layer of materialat the p-n junction called an active layer that shrinks the band gap just a bit. This encourages more electrons to fall from the end typeconduction band into holes in the p-type valence band. The best active layer forgallium nitride was already known to be indium gallium nitride, which would not only makethe band gap easier to cross, but also narrow it just the right amount to bring its blue violetgap down to true blue. This time, Akasaki andAmano didn't scoop Nakamura. They were stuck trying to grow indium gallium nitride in the first place. Amano recalled, \"It was generallysaid that gallium nitride and indium nitride would notmix, like water and oil.\" But Nakamura had an advantage, his ability to customizehis MOCVD reactor. This allowed him to use brute force, adjusting the reactorto pump as much indium as he could onto the gallium nitride, in the hopes that atleast some would stick. To his surprise, the technique worked, giving him a clean indiumgallium nitride crystal. He quickly incorporated thisactive layer into his LED, but the well worked a little too well and overflowed with electrons, leaking them back into thegallium nitride layers. Unfazed, within a few months,Nakamura had fixed this too by creating the oppositeof a well, a hill. He returned to his reactor one more time to make aluminum gallium nitride, a compound with a largerband gap that could block electrons from escapingthe well once inside. (dramatic music) The structure of the blue LEDhad become far more complex than anyone could haveimagined, but it was complete. By 1992, Sh\u016bji Nakamura had this. And I showed the chairman, I told him, \"Please, hey chairman come to my office.\" I showed him the blue LED and he said, \"ohh, this is great no?\" I became so happy. I just became, out of my office, yeah. [Derek] After 30 years of searching by countless scientists, Nakamura had done it. He had created a glorious, bright blue LED that could even be seen in daylight. It had a light outputpower of 1,500 microwatts and emitted a perfect blueat exactly 450 nanometers. It was over 100 times brighter than the previous pseudo-blueLEDs on the market. Nakamura wrote, \"I felt like I had reached the top of Mount Fuji.\" Nichia called a press conference in Tokyo to announce the world'sfirst true blue LED. The electronics industry was stunned. A researcher from Toshiba remarked, \"Everyone was caughtwith their pants down.\" The effect on Nichia's fortuneswas immediate and explosive. Orders flooded in, and by the end of 1994, they were manufacturing 1million blue LEDs per month. Within three years, the company's revenue had nearly doubled. In 1996, they made thejump from blue to white, by placing a yellow phosphor over the LED. This chemical absorbs the blue photons and re-radiates them in a broad spectrum across the visible range. Soon enough, Nichiawas selling the world's first white LED. At last, unlocking the finalfrontiers so many had doubted, LED lighting. Over the next four years,their sales doubled again. By 2001, their revenue wasapproaching $700 million a year. Over 60% came from blue LED products. Today, Nichia is one of thelargest LED manufacturers in the world with an annualrevenue in the billions. As for Nakamura, to whom Nichia owed the quadrupling of its fortunes? (dramatic music) I increased my salary, $60,000. After doubling, yeah. I heard you only got $170 bonus Each patent. So you got $170 bonus for the patent. Yes, yes. [Derek] This was all while the blue LED was generating hundreds ofmillions of dollars in sales. Eji Ogawa had always seenNakamura's stubborn individuality as a liability, not a strength. The message was clear. In 2000, after morethan 20 years at Nichia, Nakamura left the company for the US, where job offers had been pouring in. But his troubles with Nichia weren't over. He began consulting forCree, another LED company. Nichia was furious and sued himfor leaking company secrets. Nakamura responded by counter-suing Nichia for never properly compensatinghim for his invention, seeking $20 million. In 2001, the Japanesecourts ruled with Nakamura and ordered Nichia to pay him10 times his initial request. But Nichia appealed and the case was eventually settled with a payout of $8 million. In the end, this was only enough to cover Nakamura's legal fees. (soft music) This is all he got for an invention that now comprises an$80 billion industry, from house lights to streetlights. While you watch this videoon a phone, computer or TV. If you're outside followingtraffic lights or displays, chances are you are relying on blue LEDs. We might even be getting too much of them. You may have heard warnings toavoid blue light from screens before bed because it candisrupt your circadian rhythm. That all comes from thegallium nitride blue LED. But as for lighting, thereare virtually no downsides to an LED bulb. Compared to an incandescentor fluorescent bulb, they are far more efficient. They last many timeslonger, are safer to handle, and are completely customizable. 30 years after the first white LED, high-end bulbs today allow you to choose between 50,000 different shades of white. Most importantly, their pricehas come down to only a couple of dollars more than other types of bulbs. And at their efficiency,with average daily use and electricity pricing, you can recoup thatcost in only two months and continue to save for years after that. The result is a lighting revolution. In 2010, just 1% ofresidential lighting sales in the world were LED. In 2022, it was over half. Experts estimate thatwithin the next 10 years, nearly all lighting sales will be LED. (soft music) The energy savings will be enormous. Lighting accounts for 5%of all carbon emissions. A full switch to LEDs couldsave an estimated 1.4 billion tons of CO2, equivalent to taking almost half the cars in the world off the road. Today, Nakamura's researchis on the next generation of LEDs, micro LEDs, and UV LEDs. [Derek] So what arethey making in there? LEDs, lasers, power devices. This is one the best facility in the US. And this is because of you? What's a standard LED size? [Sh\u016bji] 300 times 200 microns. [Derek] Okay. [Sh\u016bji] Smallest is five microns. [Derek] That is insanely tiny. So basically you can use that for like near-eye display such as AR and VR. You could have like a retina display that's like right up here? Yep. A human hair would be about that thick. [Sh\u016bji] Yep. And that's a really, really tiny LED. UV LEDs could be used tosterilize surfaces like in hospitals or kitchens. Just flick on the UV lights and pathogens would be dead in seconds. COVID-19, you know, UV LED companies' stock prices were going, skyrocketed becauseeveryone expected to be using these UV LEDS. We can sterilize all the COVID-19, no? For emitting diode, we useindium gallium nitride. For UV, we use aluminum gallium nitride. [Derek] Okay. [Sh\u016bji] 'Cause theband gap is much bigger. [Derek] Do you thinkthis is what's coming? [Sh\u016bji] It's okay, it work,but the problem is the cost. The efficiency is less than 10%. The cost is very high. But if the efficiencybecomes more than 50%, cost is almost comparableto the mercury lamp. [Derek] And you thinkit will happen, right? Like the efficiency will go up? [Sh\u016bji] Yeah, yeah, I think so. It's just a matter of time. Yeah, I think so. [Derek] And he's even tackling one of the biggest challenges of our time. [Sh\u016bji] I'm interested in physics. [Derek] Me too! I'm still interested in nuclear fusion. So recently I started thecompany of nuclear fusion. Really? Oh yeah, last year. No way.- No way, aha. (soft music) In 2014, Nakamura, Akasaki and Amano were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for creating the blue LED. Shortly afterwards, Nakamurapublicly thanked Nichia for supporting his work, and he offered to visit and make amends, but they turned down his offer and today theirrelationship is still cold. But perhaps even moreimportant than the Nobel Prize, By the time Nakamura releasedhis blue LED in 1994, he had published over 15 papers, and he finally received hisdoctorate in engineering. Today he has published over 900 papers. Throughout his entire journey, one thing has never changed. What is your favorite color? Oh, blue. [Derek] Was it always blue? Or only after you made the LED? I was born in a fishing village. Fishing village. In front of the houseis awesome like, ocean. Blue always. While I was learningabout Nakamura's story, I realized that what sethim apart from the thousands of researchers tryingto unlock the blue LED, it wasn't necessarily his knowledge, but his determination, critical thinking, and problem solving skills.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: real science and theoretical implications of black holes, white holes, and wormholes based on Einstein's theory of general relativity"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(bell dings) Imagine you trap yournemesis in a rocket ship and blast him off towards a black hole. He looks back at you shakinghis fist at a constant rate. As he zooms in, gravity gets stronger, so you would expect him to speed up, but that is not what you see. Instead, the rocket shipappears to be slowing down. Not only that, he also appears to be shaking his fist slower and slower. That's because from your perspective, his time is slowing down at the very instant when heshould cross the event horizon, the point beyond whichnot even light can escape, he and his rocket ship do not disappear, instead, they seem to stop frozen in time. The light from the spaceshipgets dimmer and redder until it completely fades from view. This is how any object would look crossing the event horizon. Light is still coming fromthe point where he crossed, it's just too redshifted to see, but if you could see that light, then in theory you would see everything that has ever fallen into the black hole frozen on its horizon, includingthe star that formed it, but in practice, photons areemitted at discreet intervals, so there will be a last photonemitted outside the horizon, and therefore these imageswill fade after some time. This is just one of the strange results that comes outta the generaltheory of relativity, our current best theory of gravity. The first solution of Einstein's equations predicted not only black holes, but also their opposite, white holes. It also implied the existenceof parallel universes and even possibly a wayto travel between them. This is a video about thereal science of black holes, white holes, and wormholes. The general theory of relativity arose at least in partdue to a fundamental flaw in Newtonian gravity. In the 1600s Isaac Newton contemplated how an applefalls to the ground, how the moon orbits the earthand earth orbits the sun and he concluded thatevery object with mass must attract every other, but Newton was troubled by his own theory. How could masses separatedby such vast distances apply a force on each other? He wrote, \"That one body mayact upon another at a distance through a vacuum without themediation of anything else is to me, so great andabsurdity that I believe no man who has a competent faculty of thinking could ever fall into it.\" One man who definitely had acompetent faculty of thinking, was Albert Einstein andover 200 years later, he figured out how gravity is mediated. Bodies do not exert forceson each other directly. Instead, a mass like thesun curves the spacetime in its immediate vicinity. This, then curves the spacetime around it and so on all the way to the earth. So the earth orbits thesun, because the spacetime earth is passing through is curved. Masses are affected by the local curvature of spacetime, so no actionat a distance is required. Mathematically, this is described by Einstein's field equations. Can you write down theEinstein field equation? This was the the result ofEinstein's decade of hard work after special relativity and essentially what we'vegot in the field equations on one side it says, tell me about the distributionof matter and energy. The other side tells youwhat the resultant curvature of spacetime is from that distribution of matter and energyand it's a single line. It looks like, oh, this isa simple equation, right? But it's not really one equation. It's a family of equations andto make life more difficult, they're coupled equations, sothey depend upon each other and they are differential equations, so it means that there are integrals that have to be done, da, da da. So there's a whole bunch ofsteps that you need to do to solve the field equations. To see what a solution to theseequations would look like, we need a tool to understand spacetime. So imagine your floatingaround in empty space. A flash of light goes off above your head and spreads out in all directions. Now your entire future, anything that can and will ever happen to youwill occur within this bubble because the only way to get out of it would be to travel faster than light. In two dimensions, this bubbleis just a growing circle. If we allow time to run up the screen and take snapshots at regular intervals, then this light bubble traces out a cone, your future light cone. By convention, the axes arescaled so that light rays always travel at 45 degrees. This cone reveals theonly region of spacetime that you can ever hopeto explore and influence. Now imagine that insteadof a flash of light above your head, those photonswere actually traveling in from all corners of the universe and they met at that instant and then continued traveling on in their separate directions. Well, in that case then into the past, these photons also reveal a light cone, your past light cone. Only events that happened inside this cone could have affected youup to the present moment. We can simplify this diagram even further by plotting just one spatialand one time dimension. This is the spacetimediagram of empty space. If you want to measure how far apart two events are in spacetime,you use something called the spacetime interval. The interval squared isequal to minus dt squared, plus dx squared, since spacetime is flat, the geometry is the same everywhere and so this formula holdsthroughout the entire diagram, which makes it really easyto measure the separation between any two events, but around a mass, spacetime is curved andtherefore you need to modify the equation to take intoaccount the geometry. This is what solutions toEinstein's equations are like. They tell you how spacetime curves and how to measure theseparation between two events in that curved geometry. Einstein published his equations in 1915 during the First World War, but he couldn't find an exact solution. Luckily, a copy of his paper made its way to the eastern front whereGermany was fighting Russia, stationed there was one ofthe best astrophysicists of the time, Karl Schwarzschild. Despite being 41 yearsold, he had volunteered to calculate artillerytrajectories for the German army. At least until a greaterchallenge caught his attention, how to solve Einstein's field equations. Schwarzschild did thestandard physicist thing and imagined the simplestpossible scenario, an eternal static universewith nothing in it except a single sphericallysymmetric point mass. This mass was electricallyneutral and not rotating. Since this was the onlyfeature of his universe, he measured everythingusing spherical coordinates relative to this center of this mass. So r is the radius and thetaand phi give the angles. For his time coordinate, hechose time as being measured by someone far away from the mass, where spacetime is essentially flat. Using this approach,Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial solution toEinstein's equations, which nowadays we write like this. This Schwarzschild metricdescribes how spacetime curves outside of the mass. It's pretty simple andmakes intuitive sense, far away from the massspacetime is nearly flat, but as you get closer and closer to it, spacetime becomes more and more curved, it attracts objects inand time runs slower. (gunshots firing) Schwarzschild sent hissolution to Einstein, concluding with, \"The wartreated me kindly enough in spite of the heavy gunfire to allow me to get away from it all and take this walk inthe land of your ideas.\" Einstein replied, \"I have read your paper with the utmost interest,I had not expected that one could formulate theexact solution to the problem in such a simple way.\" But what seemed at first quite simple, soon became more complicated. Shortly after Schwarzschildsolution was published, people noticed two problem spots. At the center of themass, at r equals zero, this term is divided by zero,so it blows up to infinity and therefore this equation breaks down and it can no longer describewhat's physically happening. This is what's called a singularity. Maybe that point could be excused, because it's in the middle of the mass, but there's anotherproblem spot outside of it at a special distance from the center known as the Schwarzschildradius, this term blows up. So there is a second singularity.What is going on here? Well, at the Schwarzschild radius, the spacetime curvature becomes so steep that the escape velocity, thespeed that anything would need to leave there is the speed of light and that would mean that insidethe Schwarzschild radius, nothing, not even lightwould be able to escape. So you'd have this dark object that swallows up matter and light, a black hole, if you will, but most scientists doubtedthat such an object could exist, because it would require a lot of mass to collapse down into a tiny space. How could that possibly ever happen? (thrilling music) Astronomers at the time were studying what happens at the end of a star's life. During its lifetime the inwardforce of gravity is balanced by the outward radiation pressure created by the energy releasedthrough nuclear fusion, but when the fuel runs out,the radiation pressure drops. So gravity pulls all the starmaterial inwards, but how far? Most astronomers believedsome physical process would hold it up and in 1926, Ralph Fowler came up witha possible mechanism. Pauli's exclusion principles states that, \"Fermions like electronscannot occupy the same state, so as matter gets pushedcloser and closer together, the electrons each occupytheir own tiny volumes,\" but Heisenberg's uncertaintyprinciple says that, \"You can't know the positionand momentum of a particle with absolute certainty,so as the particles become more and more constrained in space, the uncertainty in their momentum, and hence their velocity must go up.\" So the more a star is compressed, the faster electrons will wiggle around and that creates an outward pressure. This electron degeneracypressure would prevent the star from collapsing completely. Instead, it would form a white dwarf with the density muchhigher than a normal star and remarkably enoughastronomers had observed stars that fit this description. One of them was Sirius B. But the relief from thisdiscovery was short-lived. Four years later, 19-year-oldSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar traveled by boat to Englandto study with Fowler and Arthur Eddington, one ofthe most revered scientists of the time. During his voyage, Chandrasekhar realized that electron degeneracypressure has its limits. Electrons can wiggle faster and faster, but only up to the speed of light. That means this effectcan only support stars up to a certain mass,the Chandrasekhar limit. Beyond this, Chandrasekhar believed, not even electron de degeneracy pressure could prevent a star from collapsing, but Eddington was not impressed. He publicly blasted Chandrasekhar saying, \"There should be a law of nature to prevent a star frombehaving in this absurd way\" and indeed scientists did discover a way that stars heavier thanthe Chandrasekhar limit could support themselves. When a star collapsesbeyond a white dwarf, electrons and protons fuse together to form neutrinos and neutrons. These neutrons are also fermions, but with nearly 2000 timesthe mass an electron, their degeneracy pressureis even stronger. So this is what holds up neutron stars. There was this conviction among scientists that even if we didn't know the mechanism, something would preventa star from collapsing into a single point andforming a black hole, because black holes were justtoo preposterous to be real. The big blow to this beliefcame in the late 1930s when Jay Robert Oppenheimerand George Volkoff found that neutron starsalso have a maximum mass. Shortly after Oppenheimerand Hartland Snyder showed that for the heaviest stars, there is nothing left to savethem when their fuel runs out, they wrote, \"This contractionwill continue indefinitely,\" but Einstein still couldn't believe it. Oppenheimer was saying thatstars can collapse indefinitely, but when Einstein looked at the math, he found that time freezes on the horizon. So it seemed likenothing could ever enter, which suggested that either there's something we don't understand or that black holes can't exist, (star explodes) but Oppenheimer offered asolution to the problem. He said to an outside observer, you could never see anything go in, but if you were travelingacross the event horizon, you wouldn't notice anything unusual and you'd go right past itwithout even knowing it. So how is this possible? We need a spacetimediagram of a black hole. On the left is thesingularity at r equals zero. The dotted line at r equals2M is the event horizon. Since the black hole doesn't move, these lines go straight up in time. Now let's see how ingoingand outgoing light ray travel in this curved geometry. When you're really far away, the future light cones areat the usual 45 degrees, but as you get closer to the horizon, the light cones get narrower and narrower, until right at the event horizon, they're so narrow thatthey point straight up and inside the horizon, thelight cones tip to the left, but something strange happenswith ingoing light rays. They fall in, but theydon't get to r equals 2M, they actually asymptote to that value as time goes to infinity, but they don't end at infinity, right? Mathematically they areconnected and come back in and they're traveling in this direction and this bothered a lot of people, this bothered people like Einstein, because he looked atthese equations and went, \"well, if nothing can crossthis sort of boundary, then how could there be black holes? How could black holes even form?\" So what is going on here? Well, what's important to recognize is that this diagram is a projection. It's basically a 2D map of four dimensional curved spacetime. It's just like projectingthe 3D Earth onto a 2D map. When you do that, youalways get distortions. There is no perfectly accurate way to map the earth onto a 2D surface, but different maps can beuseful for different purposes. For example, if you wanna keepangles and shapes the same, like if you're sailing across the ocean and you need to find your bearings, you can use the Mercator projection, that's the one Google Maps uses. A downside is that it misrepresent sizes. Africa and Greenlandlook about the same size, but Africa is actuallyaround 14 times larger. The Gall-Peters projectionkeeps relative sizes accurate, but as a result, anglesand shapes are distorted. In a similar way, we canmake different projections of 4D spacetime to studydifferent properties of it. Physical reality doesn't change, but the way the map describes it does. He had chosen to put aparticular coordinate system of a space and have a timecoordinate, and off you go. It's the most sensible thing to do, right? [Derek] People realizethat if you choose a different coordinate system by doing a coordinatesubstitution, then the singularity at the event horizon disappears. It goes away. That problem goes away andthings can actually cross into the black hole. What this tells us is that there is no real physical singularityat the event horizon. It just resulted from a poorchoice of coordinate system. Another way to visualize what's going on is by describing space as flowingin towards the black hole, like a waterfall. As you get closer, space starts flowing in faster and faster. Photons emitted by thespaceship have to swim against this flow, and thisbecomes harder and harder the closer you get. Photons emitted just outside the horizon can barely make it out, butit takes longer and longer. At the horizon, space falls in as fast as the photons are swimming. So if the horizon had a finite width, then photons would get stuck here, photons from everything that ever fell in, but the horizon is infinitely thin. So in reality, photons eithereventually escape or fall in. Inside the horizon, space falls faster than the speed of light, and so everything fallsinto the singularity. So Oppenheimer was right. Someone outside a black holecan never see anything enter because the last photons they can see will always be from justoutside the horizon, but if you yourself go, you will fall rightacross the event horizon and into the singularity. Now you can extend the waterfall model to cover all three spatial dimensions, and that gives you this, a real simulation of space flowing into a static black hole made by my friendAlessandro from ScienceClic. Later we'll use this modelto see what it's like falling into a rotating black hole. Now, I've never beensucked into a black hole, but sometimes it feels likeit when I'm stuck on the phone with a spam collar. Fortunately, today'ssponsor Incogni can help. You know, I used to getseveral spam calls a day, and they frustrated me somuch that I wrote a letter to the Do Not Call registryto get my number removed, but that didn't work and so I wanted to go on the offensive. I even contemplated making a video where I just mess with spamcallers to get some revenge for all the frustration and lost time, but I no longer have todo that thanks to Incogni. There are a lot of data brokers out there that suck up information aboutyou, a bit like a black hole. They collect things likeyour name, phone number, email address, and evenyour social security number and then they sell thisinformation on the open market, which is why we oftenget calls from people that we've never even given our number to. Incogni battles these data brokers, you simply give thempermission and they figure out who out there has yourdata, which laws apply, and then they send them the right letter, with the correct legalterms to each data broker with the request toremove your information. Now, you could do this yourself, but it's a super tediousprocess that would take days, weeks, even months, and then you'd have tokeep doing it forever. So that's something Idefinitely don't have the time and energy for, but Incognimakes this really easy. Just sign up and they'llgive you a list of companies that have your data, theseverity of each claim, and the status of each request. So far, they have filed126 requests for me, 83 of which have beencompleted saving me over 62 hours of work, but the bestpart is since I signed up, I've hardly gotten any more spam calls.

I wanna thank Incogni forsponsoring this part of the video and now back to spacetime maps. If you take this map and transform it so that incoming and outgoing light ray all travel at 45 degreeslike we're used to, then something fascinating happens. The black hole singularity on the left transforms into a curved line at the top and since the future alwayspoints up in this map, it tells us that thesingularity is not actually a place in space, instead,it's a moment in time, the very last moment in time for anything that enters a black hole. The map we've just createdis a Kruskal-Szekers diagram, but this only representsa portion of the universe, the part inside theblack holes event horizon and the part of theuniverse closest to it, but what we can do iscontract the whole universe, the infinite past, infinitedistance, and infinite future, and morph it into a single map. It's like using theuniverse's best fish eye lens. That gives us this penrose diagram. Again, light rays stillalways go at 45 degrees. So the future always points up. The infinite past is inthe bottom of the diagram. The infinite future at the top and the sides on the rightare infinitely far away. The black hole singularityis now a straight line at the top, a final moment in time. These lines are all at the same distance from the black hole. So the singularity is at r equals zero, the horizon is at r equals 2M, this line is at r equals 4M, and this is infinitely far away. All of these lines are at the same time. What's great about this mapis that it's very easy to see where you can still go andwhat could have affected you. For example, when you're here,you've got a lot of freedom. You can enter the blackhole or fly off to infinity, and you can see and receiveinformation from this area, but if you go beyond the horizon, your only possible futureis to meet the singularity. You can still, however,see and receive information from the universe. You just can't send any back out. Now think about being atthis point in the map. This is at the event horizon, and now your entire futureis within the black hole, but what is the past of this moment? Well, you can draw the past light cone and it reveals this new region. If you're inside this region, you can send signals to the universe, but no matter where youare in the universe, nothing can ever enter this region because it will never beinside your light comb. So things can come out, but never go in. This is the opposite of ablack hole, a white hole. What color is a white hole? (Geraint exhales) (Derek laughs) I mean, it's gonna be the, it's not gonna have a color, right? It's gonna be whatever'sbeing spat out of it. It depends what's inthere and gets thrown out, that's what you are going to see. So if it's got light inthere, it's got mass in there, it's all gonna be ejected. So the white hole kind of picture is the time reversepicture of a black hole, instead of things falling in,things get expelled outwards and so whilst a black hole has a membrane, the Schwarzschild horizon,which once you cross, you can't get back out, thewhite hole has the opposite. If you're inside the eventhorizon, you have to be ejected, so it kicks you out kind of thing, right? Relativity doesn't tellyou which way time flows. There's nothing in there thatsays that, that is the future and that is the past. When you are doing your mathematics and you're working outthe behavior of objects, you make a choice about whichdirection is the future, but mathematically, you could have chosen the other way, right? You could have had time pointin the opposite direction. Any solution that you find in relativity, mathematically, you can just flip it and get a time reverse solution and that's also asolution to the equations. [Derek] Now, we've been showing things being ejected to the right,but they could just as well be ejected to the left. So what's over there? This line is not at infinity, so there should be something beyond it. If we eject things in this direction, you find that they entera whole new universe, one parallel to our own. [Geraint] We can fallinto this black hole, and somebody in this universe here could fall into this blackhole in their universe, and we would find ourselvesin the same black hole. (Derek chuckles) The only downside is that we'd both soon end up in the singularity. I guess I'm just trying to understand where that universe appears in the mathematical part of the solution. Like, can you point to the partof the equation and be like, so that's our universe,and then these terms here, that's the other universe,or do you know what I mean? Like-- Yeah, well, it's coordinates, right? Imagine somebody, right, cameup with a coordinate system for the earth, but onlythe northern hemisphere and you looked at thatcoordinate system, right? And you looked at it and you said, \"Ah, I can see the coordinatesystem, it looks fine, but mathematically latitudescan be negative, right? You've only got positivelatitudes in your solution. What about the negative ones?\" And they said to you,(scoffs) \"Negative ones? No southern hemisphere, right?\" And you've gotta go, \"Well,the mathematics says that you can have negative latitudes. Maybe we should go andlook over the equator to see if there is something down there\" and I know that's akind of extreme example, because we know we live on a globe, but we don't know the full geometry of what's going on here in the sense that Schwarzschild laid down coordinates over part of the solution. It was like him onlylaying down coordinates on the northern hemisphere and other people have come along and said, \"Hey, there's a southern hemisphere\" and more than that, there's two earths. That's why it's called maximal extension. It's like, if I have thismathematical structure, then what is the extent of the coordinates that I can consider? And with the Schwarzschild black hole, you get a second universe that has its own independentset of coordinates from our universe. I want to emphasize right,this is the simplest solution to the Einstein field equations, and it already contains a black hole, white hole and two universes. [Derek] That's what you get when you push this map to its limits so that every edge ends ata singularity or infinity. And in fact, there's anotherlittle feature in here, which is that, that littlepoint there where they cross, that is an Einstein Rosen Bridge. To see it, we needto change coordinates. Now this line is at constant crustal time and it connects thespace of both universes. You can see what the spacetime is like by following this line from right to left. Far away from the event horizon, spacetime is basically flat, but as you get closerto the event horizon, spacetime starts to curve more and more. At this cross, you areat the event horizon, and if you go beyond it, youend up in the parallel universe that gives you a wormholethat looks like this. So that is hypotheticallyhow we could use a black hole to travel from one universe to another. Hypothetically, because these wormholes aren't actually stable in time. It's a bit like a bridge,but it's a bridge that is long and then becomes shorterand then becomes long again and if you try to traverse this bridge, at some point, the bridgeis only very short, right? And you say, \"Oh, well, letme just cross this bridge.\" But as you start crossingthe bridge and start running, your speed is finite, right? The speed of light roughlyand then the bridge starts, becoming stretching and younever come out the other side. [Derek] This pinchingoff always happens too fast for anything to travel through. You can also see this if youlook at the Penrose diagram, because when you're inside one universe, there isn't a light cone that can take you to the other universe. The only way to do that would be to travel faster than light, but there might be another way. Schwarzschild solutiondescribes a black hole that doesn't rotate. Yet, every star does rotate and since angular momentummust be conserved, every black hole must also be rotating. While Schwarzschild foundhis solution within weeks after Einstein published his equations, solving them for a spinning mass turned out to be much harder. Physicists tried, but 10 yearsafter Schwarzschild solution, they still hadn't solved it. 10 years turned into20, which turned into 40 and then in 1963, RoyKerr found the solution to Einstein's equationsfor a spinning black hole, which is far more complicatedthan Schwarzschild solution and this comes with afew dramatic changes. The first is that the structureis completely different. The black hole nowconsists of several layers. It's also not sphericallysymmetric anymore. This happens because the rotation causes it to bulge around the equator. So it's only symmetricabout its axis of spin. Alessandro from scienceclick simulated what happens around this spinning black hole. Space gets dragged aroundwith the black hole taking you and theparticles along with it. When you get closer,space gets dragged around faster and faster untilit goes around faster than the speed of light, you've now entered intothe first new region, the ergosphere. No matter how hard youfire your rockets here, it's impossible to stay stillrelative to distance stars, but because space doesn'tflow directly inward, you can still escape the black hole. When you travel in further,you go through the next layer, the outer horizon, the point of no return. Here you can only go inwards, but as you get draggedin deeper and deeper, something crazy happens,you enter another region, one where you can movearound freely again, so you're not doomed to the singularity. You're now inside the inner event horizon. Here you can actually see the singularity In a normal black hole, it's a point, but it in a rotating black hole, it actually expands out to be a ring and there are weird things happened with spacetime inside thecenter of a black hole, a rotating black hole, but it's thought that you can actually fly through the singularity. [Derek] We need a Penrose diagram of a spinning black hole,where before the singularity was a horizontal line at the top here, the singularity liftsup and moves to the sides, revealing this new regioninside the inner horizon. Here we can move around freelyand avoid the singularity, but these edges aren't atinfinity or a singularity, so there must be something beyond them. Well, when you venture further, you could find yourself in a white hole, which would push you outinto a whole nother universe. You can have these pictures whereby you're in one universe, youfall into a rotating black hole, you fly through the singularity, and you pop out into a newuniverse from a white hole, and then you can justcontinue playing this game. Extending this diagram infinitely far. but there is still onething we haven't done, brave the singularity. So you aim straight towardsthe center of the ring and head off towards it,but rather than time ending, you now find yourself inuniverse, a strange universe, one where gravity pushes instead of pulls. This is known as an anti-verse. If that's too weird,you can always jump back across the singularityand return to a universe with normal gravity. And I know this is basicallyscience fiction, right? But if you take thesolutions of relativity at, you know, essentially at facevalue and add on a little bit, which is what Penrosedoes here, he says this, \"oh look, these shapes are very similar, I can just stick these together.\" Then this is the conclusion that you get. Now we have effectively an infinite number of universes all connectedwith black hole, white holes all the way through andyou, of you go to explore, but it'll be a very braveperson who's the first one who's gonna leap intoa rotating black hole to find out if this is correct? (Derek chuckles) Yeah, I would not sign up for that. So could these maximallyextended Schwarzschild and Kerr solutionsactually exist in nature? Well, there are some issues. Both the extended Schwarzschildand Kerr solutions are solutions of eternal blackholes in an empty universe. As you say, it's an eternal solution. So it stretches infinitelyfar into the past and infinitely far into the future and so there's no formationmechanism in there, it's just a static solution and I think that is part of the, part of the reason why black holes are realized in our universeand white holes aren't- Or might not be. Or might not be, or I'm reasonably I, personally, I'm reasonably confident that they don't exist, right? [Derek] For the maximallyextended Kerr solution, there's also another problem. If you're an immortalastronaut inside the universe, you can send light into the black hole, but because there'sinfinite time compressed in this top corner, you canpile up light along this edge, which creates an infinite flux of energy along the inner horizon. This concentration of energy then creates its own singularity, sealing off the ringsingularity and beyond. My suspicion and the suspicion of some other people in the field is that this inner horizon will become singular and you will not be able to gothrough these second copies. So all the white holes,wormholes, other universes and anti universes disappear. Does that mean that realwormholes are impossible? In 1987, Michael Morris andKip Thorne looked at wormholes that an advanced civilization could use for interstellar travel,ones that have no horizons, so you can travel back andforth, are stable in time, and have some other properties like being able to construct them. They found severalgeometries that are allowed by Einstein's general relativity. In theory, these couldconnect different parts of the universe, making asort of interstellar highway. They might even be able toconnect to different universes. The only problem is thatall these geometries require an exotic kind of matter with a negative energy density to prevent the wormhole from collapsing. This exotic kind of matter, is really against theloss of physics, so it's, I have the prejudicethat it will not exist. I'm bothered by the fact that we say that the science fiction wormholesare mathematically possible. It's true, it's mathematically possible in the sense that there'ssome geometry that can exist, but Einstein's theoryis not just geometries, it's geometries plus field equations. If you use the kindsof properties of matter that matter actually has,then they're not possible. So I feel that the reasonthey're not possible is very strong. So according to ourcurrent best understanding, it seems likely that whiteholes, traversable wormholes, and these parallel universes don't exist, but we also used to thinkthat black holes didn't exist. So maybe we'll be surprised again. I mean, we have one universe, right? Good, why can't we have two. (whimsical music)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: six degrees of separation"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- In 1999, the German newspaper \"Die Zeit\" ran an experiment. They asked a falafel salesman and former theater director, Salah ben Ghaly, who in the world he would most like to be connected to. He chose his favorite actor, Marlon Brando. So the reporters then searched for a chain of friends, family or acquaintances, people who knew each other on a first name basis, who could connect ben Ghaly to Brando. As it happens, ben Ghaly had a friend in California. This friend worked alongside the boyfriend of a woman who was the sorority sister of the daughter of the producer of the film \"Don Juan DeMarco,\" starring Marlon Brando. So in total, it took just six steps, six degrees of separation. And the idea is that this is not a unique example, that you could connect any two people on the planet in six steps or less. But is it really true? And if it is, how does it affect our lives? - How is this possible in a world of now eight billion people that we could be that close, just six hops or less? Does that affect how diseases spread, how information travels? Our math showed, the question is not why is the world small, it's really how could it be otherwise? But then I got a call from the FBI. We are making the world smaller all the time. Like it's supposed to be good, and yet it does expose you to toxicity and malevolence that you might've been shielded from. - You look at the net effect of it, and it's actually been pretty negative by a lot of measures. People have suffered. - It's not only dangerous in terms of disease propagation, but anything malevolent now has conduits that it didn't used to have. - If we were all connected to everyone else on the planet completely at random, then it would be almost a mathematical certainty that any two of us would be connected through fewer than six steps. - Let's suppose I have my 100 friends out of eight billion people. Each of them knows 100 people. So two steps away from me is gonna encompass 100 times 100 people. That's already 10-to-the-fourth people. And so if you do 100 to the fifth power, that's 10 to the 10th, and that's more people than there are on Earth. So notice that number is five, I said, \"To the fifth power.\" That's the ballpark reason why six degrees (laughing) of separation is true. - But the shocking thing about this is, the calculation you've just outlined is about having 100 friends at random out of 10 billion and they're all over the world, but we know that in the real world, that's nowhere near what the distribution of friends are like. - Yeah, absolutely true. So this really crude calculation I did is absurd, for the reason that you said. The world is very far from random. - The truth is people naturally cluster geographically. Most of the people you know live close to you, and they also have a higher probability of knowing each other. If you calculate the fraction of people you know who also know each other, that is a measure of the clustering in the network. So let's try a model with a high degree of clustering. Imagine all eight billion people on Earth are arranged into a circle, and say each person knows the 100 people closest to them. So 50 to the left and 50 to the right. Well, in this case, the furthest person you can connect to is just 50 people away. So if you wanted to connect to someone on the other side of the planet through a chain of people who know each other, well, it would take 80 million steps, and to connect any two people would take on average 40 million steps. Even just getting 10% to the way there would take eight million steps. And six steps would get you, well, here. (inquisitive music) This is the paradox of six degrees of separation. We know that we live in these local clusters of friends and acquaintances, but we also seem to be able to connect anyone anywhere in just six steps. 10 years ago, I did my own experiment on this, and I found that the average Veritasium viewer was only 2.7 degrees of separation from me. In social science, this is known as the small-world problem, named after the phenomenon where you're say on holiday somewhere and you bump into a stranger who somehow knows your best friend, and you say, \"Wow, it's such a small world.\" (light music) No text In the mid-1990s, two mathematicians, Duncan Watts and Steve Strogatz, set out to solve this small-world problem. - Duncan really sort of had very far-seeing imagination at that point. - We had computers that allowed us to simulate environments that were too complicated for for math to work. - [Derek] Up until then, physicists had studied networks that were ordered and regular, like crystal lattices. And mathematicians, like Paul Erdos, had done lots of work on totally random networks, but no one had studied what happens in between. - There must be some enormous middle ground, and that's what Duncan and I felt like we're starting to explore. - [Derek] To study this middle ground, Watts and Strogatz imagined a simple regular network of people, or nodes, dotted around a circle, each connected to a few of their nearest neighbors. - And so we had this idea, \"We're gonna start with the physicist end of regular, and now we're gonna turn the randomness knob to make it more and more random through these random shortcuts.\" - [Derek] We all have some experience with shortcuts. - I belonged to this club called the Internet Chess Club. I got to be very friendly with a guy in Holland. That connection makes the world small, because now, even though my friends don't realize it, they're only one step away from a guy in Holland. And so that kind of connection where you sort of connect to someone outside your normal circle is what we came to call a shortcut. - [Derek] So they went round the circle, disconnecting some of the links and reconnecting them at random to a different node in the network. And as they did that, they watched what happened to the average number of steps it took to get from any one node in the network to another, hopping between connected nodes. In other words, the degree of separation. - This is now the moment for the big reveal. As Duncan turned the knob in his computer simulations, as soon as he introduced a few shortcuts, the world immediately gets as small as a random graph. - [Derek] When they had rewired just 1% of the links to shortcuts, the average degree of separation dropped from 50 in the original fully ordered network to 10. But Watts and Strogatz also tracked how clustered the network was. That's the fraction of a node's connections that are also connected to each other, or in other words, the fraction of my friends who are also friends with each other. What they found is that clustering remained high for much longer. - The world immediately gets as small as a random graph, but it stays as clustered as if it were still regular. So you could simultaneously have the clustering that we know is real and the small world that we know is real. - Now, in Watts and Strogatz's model, they looked at 1,000 nodes, but if you apply their model to the eight billion people on Earth, well, then you would only need three out of every 10,000 friendships to be a shortcut, and the average degrees of separation drops to six. - Our math showed, the question is not why is the world small, it's really how could it be otherwise? Duncan started saying to me, \"This is about discovering a whole new universe, and its properties and laws.\" I recognized that he was right. - I just wanted to sort of reflect on what you said about these sort of shortcuts. I think I've had this phenomenon happen to me sometimes in my life where I'm sort of invited to an event and it seems like a very random event. Often I kind of feel like, (sighing) \"I don't really wanna go.\" (Steven laughing) \"You know, none of my friends are going.\" But then, maybe at the last minute, I just say like, \"Well, let's just roll the dice.\" And I find that almost invariably those are productive meetings. I'm kind of wondering if there's a takeaway for people here, which is that they should put themselves in situations where the probability of forming these shortcut links, would it sort of increase the luck in your life? - You have just put your finger on a very famous phenomenon in sociology that is called the strength of weak ties. 'Cause you ask people how they got their job, and people would say, \"Oh yeah, I heard about it from, you know, Randy.\" And then he'd say, \"Oh, is Randy a friend of yours?\" and people invariably would say, \"No, he's an acquaintance. I wouldn't call him a friend, he's an acquaintance.\" That's a weak tie. The strong tie is your best friend or your circle of friends. - [Derek] Excited about their breakthrough, Watts and Strogatz wanted to test their small-world model on some real-world data, but this was 1996. - [Steven] We had to think, \"Well, where are we gonna get data on big networks where we could test this?\" And it was not so easy, the internet was not mapped out, Google didn't exist. - [Derek] So they turned to an unusual source. - [Steven] There was only one nervous system that had been mapped at that time, which was the worm, C. elegans. Tiny worm, like a millimeter, that you can find in the dirt. A favorite of neurobiologists. They knew every cell in the body of C. elegans from the time it's a single cell 'til it becomes a whole organism. So they had the total wiring diagram of that organism. - [Derek] Watts and Strogatz tested their model on the worm's neural network. The worm has precisely 282 neurons, and on average, they're connected to 14 others. If you lay that all out in a line along the worm's body, the neurons at the ends would be separated by around 40 steps, and the average degree of separation would be around 14. But when Watts and Strogatz ran the calculations, they found the average degrees of separation between any two neurons was just 2.65. To put that in context, if they were connected totally at random, it would be 2.25. - [Steven] And yes, okay, so bingo, that was a small world. Then we were popping the champagne. I mean, that was really exciting that nature had done that. So then we thought, \"Well, okay, but this should be true of lots of networks because nature can't resist this mechanism.\" - [Derek] So they looked at Hollywood actors and power grids across the US. Sure enough, they were both small-world networks. For example, in the database of over 200,000 Hollywood actors, the average degree of separation was less than four. Dangerfield was in \"Caddy Shack\" with Bill Murray, and Bill Murray was in \"She's Having a Baby\" with Kevin Bacon. - [Steven] Then the real payoff for us, as people interested in dynamical systems more than graph theory, was, \"Okay, so what? You know, so what if the world is small? Does that affect how things get in sync? Does it affect how diseases spread? Does it affect how information travels? Whatever.\" And so we did a number of experiments, again, in the computer, like that. - [Derek] Take disease. I wanted to know how a few shortcuts No text would affect how disease spreads through a network. So I asked Casper and the team to make a simulation. - [Casper] And then the question to you is, do you wanna start with a completely regular world where it's completely clustered or do you wanna start with completely random? - [Derek] I would start with a regular world. - [Casper] Okay. There it goes. - [Derek] There's the spread of infections. - [Casper] Yeah. - Wow. - So it takes over the world, completely. Well, if every step was a day, it would take 73 days for the, you know, infection to take over this entire world. - [Derek] Well, let's introduce a few shortcuts and see. - [Casper] Okay, let's make it small world, like 10%. Let's go. - [Derek] Boom. Wow, that's really dramatic. - (laughing) Whoa. Right? - That's really dramatic and very fast. - Yeah, so fast. Yeah, after 26 days, the whole world. - [Derek] And that ramp up does look exponential at the beginning. - Right? - And then it kind of looks linear there as well, but it's almost like you can't go any faster. - [Casper] Yeah. Okay, so now let's make it a completely random network. (inquisitive music) - [Derek] Boom. - Boom. - Crazy. How many days now for a fully random network? - [Casper] 25. - [Derek] Basically identical. - [Casper] Which is crazy because in the random case, all your links are random. You know, in the small-world case, it's just 10%. It's like if one out of your 10 friends are a shortcut, which, you know, for some people might be a bit much, but I reckon for you, it's probably about right. - [Derek] Yeah, I got lots of shortcuts. (Casper laughing) - [Casper] But the crazy thing is No text that in this simulation, we only use 100 nodes. And if you use the same model to the eight billion people on Earth, then you would actually need less than 1% of all your links to be shortcuts. - [Derek] In 1998, Watts and Strogatz published their findings in a three-page article in \"Nature,\" and the paper took off. Within a few years, the paper already had hundreds of citations. By 2014, it was ranked the 63rd-most-cited paper of all time. And today, it's got around 58,000 citations. That's higher than Peter Higgs' paper on the Higgs boson, and almost three times as many as Watson and Crick's Nobel Prize-winning paper on DNA. - [Steven] So it's probably worth making that distinction that citations are one measure of impact. We're cited a lot more than Einstein, and I think you know who's more important? (Derek laughing) It's not us, but it does mean people thought it was worth citing. We had many tens of thousands of citations from people in far-flung fields, from neuroscience, to sociology, to graph theory, to computer science. Even, you know, English literature, people would do things like draw networks between words. - [Derek] Is there any irony in the fact that this paper on global networks goes viral itself? - [Steven] (laughing) Yes, I think so, maybe so. (record scratching) - [Derek] But then things got a little weird. - [Steven] That's when I started getting some strange phone calls. I got a call from somebody at the FBI. I was a little scared, \"What's the FBI calling me about?\" And so I called back, and the person who picks up says, \"Hair and Fiber.\" (laughing) I was calling the Hair and Fiber network at the FBI, the people who do you know criminology based on what telltale hairs or fibers are left on the victim's clothes after they've been murdered. There was a guy who said, \"What happens when the police have a suspect and they say, \"You have fibers on your sweater that match the hair of the victim,\" and then the defense lawyer says, \"Well, you know, maybe the victim was on a bus and left her fibers on the bus, and then my client sat on the, a secondary transfer,\" they would call it, \"of these fibers, that doesn't prove anything?\" So the FBI wanted to know, what's the probability of secondary transfers compared to primary transfers from actually killing the person? And like I said, \"Well, I don't, what do I know now?\" (Steven and Derek laughing) - [Derek] Now, that's a Steve Strogatz problem. For most of us, a random caller telling you they're an FBI agent is probably a scam. Chances are they got your number from a data leak or a data broker. Anytime you provide your name, phone number, even your Social Security number, that personal information can be scraped, packaged and sold to anyone who will pay.

No text In 1998, Albert-Laszlo Barabasi was studying the internet. At that time, there were around 800 million webpage, but despite the web's enormous size, Barabasi found that on average you could connect any two sites with just 19 clicks. Apparently the web was a small world too, but the strange thing was, it didn't look anything like the small-world network in Watts and Strogatz's model. - [Albert-Laszlo] We ended up mapping out a region of World Wide Web, and we had a very clear expectation of how that network should look like. - [Derek] Barabasi thought the distribution of pages and links would resemble a bell curve, similar to what you'd get for people's height across a population. Most sites would have some average number of links and there would be very few outliers either side. But that is not what he saw. (inquisitive music) - [Albert-Laszlo] And so we measured the distribution, and it didn't look anything like what we expected. (laughing) - [Derek] The curve started out steep. Loads of websites had not many links. Then there was this really long tail. - [Albert-Laszlo] And here we saw webpages that had not only a little more, but sometimes 100 times more links than the average degree or the average node on the website. - [Derek] These were websites like Yahoo, super-connectors that linked to thousands of other sites. Barabasi called them hubs, because when he mapped out the network, they resembled the hub of a wheel, with spokes going out to hundreds of other pages. And it was these hubs that made the web a small world, not shortcuts. So Barabasi wondered, \"How could this apply to other networks too?\" - [Albert-Laszlo] Most real networks, or virtually all large networks, follow two very fundamental principles. First, any large network out there never pops out as a large network, but it grows, right? You have a tiny World Wide Web in 1991, and now we have trillions of nodes on the World Wide Web. How did we get one to a trillion? One node at a time, one website at a time. All the networks out there, no matter how old, how fast they emerged, they always emerged with some kind of growth process. So if you think about networks, you must build in that growth process. Number two, when a new node comes in, you join Facebook, whom you gonna connect to, right? And it is somewhat unpredictable, but it's biased. Your connections are always biased towards the more connected nodes, simply because you are more likely to know more connected node than less connected node. We named this process preferential attachment. - [Derek] Barabasi reasoned that these two principles could explain how hubs naturally emerge when a network grows. So together with his colleague, Reka Albert, he ran a simulation. - [Casper] We've also got a simulation for this. They started with a simple network of just a few connected nodes. Then they begin adding new nodes to the network one at a time, with just one condition, they'd be more likely to connect the nodes that already had more links. - [Derek] That's so cool. Looks very biological, very organic. Also, I like how the nodes come out and they don't just sort of stop in one spot, they kind of like wiggle around and like find their location. I really like enjoy this. Kind of like a space station. - [Casper] That's what I was thinking. - [Derek] Or like a space colony, right? - [Casper] Yeah, yeah, right? Like each little center one could be a planet, then you've got all the sort of stations going around it. - [Derek] Yes. - [Casper] So when Barabasi and Albert let these networks evolve, hubs emerged. - [Albert-Laszlo] And we showed that growth and preferential attachment together naturally lead to the emergence of hubs. - [Derek] With this simulation, Barabasi and Albert showed how hubs could emerge in virtually any complex network. Take airports for example. In 1955, Chicago O'Hare opened to commercial flights. Unlike neighboring airport, Midway, it had long runways and plenty of space for new jet aircraft. Airlines began shifting service there. As more airlines connected flights to O'Hare, passengers had more options to connect, making it increasingly attractive. After deregulation in the 1970s, more airlines were free to add routes and the feedback loop accelerated. Each new route made the airport more useful to passengers and more appealing to other airlines. Today, O'Hare is the most connected airport in the United States, with direct flights to well over 200 destinations. - [Casper] But we don't just see hubs in manmade networks. In food webs, you have a few keystone species, like Atlantic cods, that connect hundreds of predators and prey. And in the metabolic networks in our cells, you have a few molecules, like ATP, that govern hundreds of chemical reactions. In the neural networks in our brain, you have a few regions, like the prefrontal cortex that link hundreds of different functions. Now, as each of these networks evolved and grew over time, you had new species, new reactions and new circuits that latched on to what was already well connected. And so you get this sort of natural growth. Now, preferential attachment isn't the only mechanism that can create hubs. There are plenty of other factors at play, particularly in these more complex biological systems. But what Barabasi's and Albert's simulation showed is that all it takes is a tiny bias when growing a network and hubs end up being inevitable. - [Albert-Laszlo] Once hubs are there, they fundamentally change (laughing) the way the system behaves and the way we understand that system. - [Derek] Hubs like O'Hare mean you can get pretty much anywhere in the world in just a few flights. But that connectivity also has consequences. In August, 2025, thunderstorms shut down Chicago O'Hare, and 280 flights were canceled and 80 were diverted. Overflow hit at least six other US airports. While some planes stuck in Chicago never left for Europe or Asia. - [Albert-Laszlo] Bad weather in Chicago totally changes not only the the travel pattern in Chicago, but within 24 hours, the whole country is being affected by that. - [Derek] And we see the same phenomenon in natural networks, knocking out one keystone species, like Atlantic cod, can destabilize an entire ecosystem. - [Albert-Laszlo] So this is what we call the Achilles' heel of networks. And this could be good news or it could be bad news, right? Good news if you wanna create drugs to kill bacteria, then you're gonna go for the hub. - [Derek] This idea has created a whole new field of network medicine where researchers develop drugs to target crucial parts of a disease's metabolic network. But understanding the role of hubs doesn't just help develop cures for a disease, it can help us control its spread. (inquisitive music) In 1990, Thailand was facing one of the fastest-growing HIV epidemics in the world. The government tried broad campaigns, like posters, TV ads and school talks, telling everyone to use condoms. But the infection kept spreading. So in 1991, the government tried something different. They started targeting hubs. They told brothels around the country that every client must use a condom or else they'd be shut down. And the impact was huge. For example, HIV infections among young men joining the military dropped by more than 50%. And by 2013, Thailand's Ministry of Public Health estimated the policy had prevented over five million infections. All because they realized the importance of hubs. (upbeat music) - [Casper] Hubs and shortcuts make any complex network more connected than it seems. That means things spread quickly, No text whether that's airport delays, information or disease. But could that impact run even deeper? I mean, could the structure of our social network influence our very behavior and beliefs without us even being aware of it? - [Derek] Back in 1997, Watts and Strogatz investigated just that, using a game called the prisoner's dilemma. It's probably the most famous problem in game theory, and it's used to represent a ton of different conflicts we see in the real world. We've actually done a full video on it before, but here's a quick recap. The premise is simple. A banker with a chest full of gold invites you and another player to play. You each get two choices, you can cooperate or defect. If you both cooperate, you each get three coins. But if you defect while your opponent cooperates, you get five coins and they get nothing. And if you both defect, then you each get one coin. So what would you do? Suppose your opponent cooperates, then you could also cooperate and get three coins, or you could defect and get five coins instead. So you're better off defecting. But what if your opponent defects? Well, you could cooperate and get no coins or you could defect and at least get one. So no matter what your opponent does, your best option is always to defect. Now, if your opponent is also rational, they'll reach the same conclusion and therefore they'll also defect. And as a result, when you both act rationally, you both end up in the suboptimal situation of getting one coin each when you could have gotten three. (bright music) But in 1980, Professor Robert Axelrod found that if you play your opponent hundreds of times, well, then cooperation wins out. He ran a tournament among the world's leading game theorists and all the most successful strategies were nice. The winning strategy was called tit for tat, because its default position was to cooperate and it would only defect in retaliation. He also showed that a small cluster of cooperators can work together to overcome a world of defectors. - [Casper] So that's kind of the scene we're setting, right? You get to this realistic place where you get tit-for-tat life strategies to sort of dominate the world, because in Axelrod's tournament, every strategy played against every other strategy, or they only interacted sort of with their near neighborhood, which is, you know, the small cluster. And now you could wonder, \"Well, what if we start changing the way this works? What if we put them on a network?\" - [Derek] Well, Watts and Strogatz simulated their own version of the prisoner's dilemma that did just that. They set up a regular network where each player was connected to a few players on either side. Then they would simultaneously play against all of their connections. The rules were simple. If most of a player's connections cooperated, then that player would also cooperate. But if most of their connections defected, then they would defect in retaliation. They started with a small cluster of cooperators surrounded by defectors, and they watched the network evolve. Over time, what they saw was cooperation spread, just like what Axelrod had found. But then they reran the simulation, this time with a few links rewired to shortcuts. And all of a sudden, the cooperators were crushed and they ended up with a world of defectors. (defectors whirring) And when they started from a totally regular network and gradually increased the fraction of shortcuts, they found there was this critical fraction beyond which the percentage of cooperators at the end of the game drops to zero. - I think the thing that's really crazy is that you've taken the exact same strategies with all the same properties, same character traits and personalities, if you will, and you're not changing any of that. All you're changing is the way they're connected, and you go from a world where everyone's completely nice and working together to one where it's filled with nastiness and people betraying each other, only by changing how they're connected. - [Derek] It's like if the bulk of your interactions are sort of negative, then you start being negative too and you just contribute to the overall negativity. Whereas if like a few people are nice, and you can imagine, \"Oh, that makes me feel good and so I'm gonna be nicer to that person.\" - [Steven] The intuition for that is that cooperation is fostered by having little clumps. If I have a little clump of people that are kind of my buds, we get to have a lot of encounters, and cooperation tends to emerge from familiarity, the same way that iteration helps, that if I know that I'm gonna see you again, I'm gonna encounter you again, it ends up being to my advantage to cooperate. Whereas like the world of the internet, where anyone can get on Twitter and badmouth anyone else, that tends to discourage. We don't have pockets, you don't have communities. - [Derek] It kind of explains this keyboard warrior phenomenon, and that, yeah, people say things on the internet they wouldn't say to-- - They wouldn't. Most people are nice in real life. - [Derek] (laughing) Yeah. - [Steven] It's funny that the small world, I know, you'd think the small world's, well, 'cause it's a Disney song, right? \u266a It's a small world after all \u266a Like it's supposed to be good, and yet it does expose you to toxicity and malevolence that you might've been shielded from in the small town. Social media has kind of been toxic. The initial idea being 'hey we connect up a bunch of people and people who have been separated geographically we connect you with your old friends.' You look of the net effect of it and it's actually been pretty negative by a lot of measures. Intrigued by the findings, Watts started wondering if the results applied to the real world too. For years after I did this work I had wanted to test the hypothesis with actual human subjects So he got some volunteers to play a similar game called the public goods game across different network structures He was expecting that, like they found previously, more shortcuts in a network, would make cooperation less likely to emerge. But what he found was, the structure of the network had no effect. Cooperation was just as likely to emerge in a totally clustered network as it was in a totally random one. - [Duncan] We were very puzzled by this result. And then we kind of did some more work. - [Derek] When Watts dug deeper, he realized that the network structure did matter. In the more clustered networks, people were more likely to copy each other. So if by chance someone started out cooperating, then everyone would cooperate. But it was equally likely that someone would start out by defecting, in which case everyone else would defect. And over all the games they played, these two effects canceled each other out, which is why it seemed like the network structure didn't matter. - [Duncan] It's sort of on a knife edge, right? Where like one person does something selfish and everything goes south. In another world, everybody kind of holds it together and everything goes well. It's crazy that the world could be like on a knife edge like that, you know, could tip one way or the other, kind of just depends on how someone gets out of bed that day. But then Watts realized something. See, in real life, you can choose who you hang out with. So he reran the experiment allowing players to change who they were playing with. And this time he used the prisoner's dilemma so that players could easily identify the defectors. - [Derek] And the finding was clear, the more you allowed players to choose who they were playing with, the more likely they were to cooperate. - [Casper] You can make this a lot better for yourself by just acting and being decisive and being proactive about things. - [Derek] Yeah, yeah, it's a thing I try to teach my kids too, like if someone's annoying you, just ignore them. Like there's nothing to be gained by continuing to interact with people who are bringing negativity into your life. - [Casper] In fact, making a choice can be powerful in more than one way. There's something about the world that makes it prone to those upheavals. Meaning it's always kind of poised on an edge of instability. And that gives each of us more power than you'd think we would have. It is actually possible for individual people to start movements that grow and take off. And ultimately, if you look at history, that is what happens. It's always one person who is stubborn and does something that leads to 10 people, 1,000 people, and things change because of it. It always starts with one person somehow. It's the Steve Jobs quote, right? The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. And the wonderful thing is, it all starts with you believing you have that power. - Yeah Learning all about network science has taught me many things, but perhaps the most important is that our networks shape us, but our actions shape the networks. So choose both wisely. - [Casper] Hey, if you made it this far, all the simulations we ran through with Derek, we will actually make them available on a website that you can go to so you can play around with them yourself. So thank you so much for watching, we really appreciate it. And yeah, see you for the next one."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: myths and misconceptions about planes"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Most plane doors aren't locked. There are no keys, no sensorsor passcodes to secure them. If someone wants to pullthe lever, they can. A man opened the emergency exit door and forced his way off the plane. And yet with 40 millionflights each year, these doors are virtuallynever opened in flight. So, why not? Your self preservation, surely. Common sense. Most people are, you know, smart enough to not mess with that. The real answer relieson where planes fly. How high do planes fly approximately? 10,000 km oris that overshooting it? I think that's overshooting it. I think you'd be in space. 25,000 km. That's the height of a plane flying? Is that way too low? It's too much. It's too much. Too much. Too much. Bring it down. Maybe yeah, 1,000 km? 1,000 km, still space. 50,000 ft, I think. Yeah, some of them cango up to 43,000 ft. 30,000 ft. 38,000 ft. Yeah. Why do they fly that high? Uhh... I don't know. Safety, I guess. Probably to avoidcollision with other aircraft and if there's high mountain ranges. I don't know,when storms or weather hit? My guess is to avoidthe turbulent weather. I think that's a decent guess. Now, it's true that one of the benefits of flying at 30,000 ft is a smoother ride. This is high in the troposphere, the layer in which most weather occurs. So, there's less turbulence and fewer storms to navigate around. But this is not the mainreason that planes fly so high. The bigger reason, of course, is money. As you go up, the density of air decreases and at 33,000 ft or 10 km, the density of air is just a third of what it is at sea level. So flying at this altitude, the plane runs into a thirdof the air molecules it would closer to the ground. That means the planecan fly about 73% faster for the same amount of thrust. And as a result, you getto your destination faster and since you spend less time in the air, you burn less fuel. It seems in a way that likeclimbing is wasted energy. Can you compare like thedescent to the ascent? Do you essentially get the energy back as you fall down the other side? Yeah. When we climb, we burnabout 80 kilos per minute. In cruise, we burn about40 kilos per minute. And in descent, it's maybe 10. So, it's almost negligible. Not only that, jet enginesare more efficient at altitude. They work by compressingair at the intake, mixing it with fuel and igniting it. So, the combustion productsare ejected very fast from the exhaust nozzle. Now, this process is moreefficient the colder the air is. And at altitude, the temperature is around minus 50 degrees Celsius, which is a lot colderthan an average of plus 15 here at the ground. So, flying higher means youburn less fuel for less time and avoid the weatherand associated turbulence of lower altitudes. The other reason you wanna fly high is to take advantage ofthe jet stream tailwinds and the company likes people who do that, because you're burning less fuel, so it's less money. But there is a problemwith flying this high. The air up there is unbreathable. If you were suddenly teleported to the top of Mount Everest, aheight lower than planes fly, you would remain consciousfor only about three minutes. This is because in addition to density dropping withaltitude, so does air pressure. Air pressure actually falls off faster, because it depends on theweight of all the air above you. So at 10 km, the air pressure is only a quarter ofwhat it is at sea level. To be clear, the air is still 21% oxygen, but the partial pressure of oxygen, the pressure exertedsolely by oxygen molecules is around 5.5 kilopascals, which is a quarter ofwhat it is on the ground. Now at this pressure, notenough oxygen molecules can force their way intoyour blood in your lungs. To function normally, humansneed an oxygen partial pressure of at least 16 kilopascals. So, all the cabins of airplanes that cruise at high altitudemust be pressurized. A little bit of air iscontinuously brought into the cabin from outside. It actually comes in fromthe compression stage of the jet engines. That is what maintainsbreathable air inside the plane. The downside is that you are taking away a little bit of theefficiency of the engines. Now, pressurizing the cabin required a radical redesign of aircraft. Before pressurization, planes would fly up to 10,000 feet oraround three kilometers, where the partial pressureof oxygen is 15 kilopascals, just at the limit ofwhat people can handle. On these planes, doors opened outward and there wasn't much concernabout the seal around them since the pressure wasthe same on both sides. But once planes were pressurized, all the doors were changedto be the shape of a plug. They're wider on theinside than the outside. That way the higherpressure inside the cabin pushes the door into its frame,creating an airtight seal. How airtight is a cabin? It's pretty airtight, butnot completely airtight. So, you'll notice for example, every time that someoneflushes the toilet, you'll see some of theair pressure go down. So every time that happens, you can actually see the cabinaltitude jump a little bit. And this is why plane doorsand emergency exit doors don't need locks. The difference in pressurebetween the pressurized cabin and the low pressure exterior is so great that no one is strong enoughto pull the door inwards. And if someone had come up and turned that whileyou're mid-flight? Nothing. Even modern planedoors that open outward are shaped like plugs. They're just cleverly designed. The main passenger door on a Boeing 737 is both wider and tallerthan the frame it needs to pass through. But when you pull the lever, gates at the top and bottom fold in, reducing the height just enough. However, the sides are still too wide. So, the door first hasto pop inside and rotate. It's that movement inwardsthat is impossible at altitude. It would require a force equivalent to lifting 9,000 kilograms. And airplane cabins aren'teven fully pressurized to the sea level pressureof 101.3 kilopascals. You may have noticed this if you take a bag of chips on a plane. It's easy to squish on the ground but as the plane climbs, thepressure in the cabin drops and the chip bag seems toinflate like a balloon. I measured the pressure in my plane and at cruising altitude, the pressure dropped to 77 kilopascals. Meaning the partial pressure of oxygen was only 16 kilopascals, the minimum required for peopleon the plane to feel normal. This has some unintended consequences. Do you think you fart more in a plane? (interviewee laughing) If I did, I'd blame someone else. I feel like no. No. No I can't let it rip, no way in the world. Do you think you fart more ina plane than on the ground? A hundred percent, no hesitation. Sure, I mean it's gotta dowith the cabin pressure, right? So as you go up, thatcavity in here now expands and the air wants to go somewhere, and the quickest place it can go is south. Bag of chips just popped by itself. Now, the InternationalSpace Station is pressurized to sea level pressure, 101.3 kilopascals. So, why are planes pressurized to the minimum extent possible to carry human passengers? Well, it's actuallyfor a very good reason. In 1988, Aloha Airlines 243 was en route from Hiloto Honolulu, Hawaii. The cabin was beingpressurized as we've described, but unfortunately, this plane'sfuselage had a small crack and all of a sudden at 24,000 feet, the crack widened and the whole roof tore off the front of the plane. Miraculously the pilotswere able to land safely and only one person was killed. The difference between theInternational Space Station and a plane is that theISS was pressurized once and it stays pressurized. But a plane experiencesa pressure difference every time it climbs to cruising altitude. So, the fuselage is stretched and then relaxed with every flight. Stretched and relaxed,stretched and relaxed. The Aloha Airlines plane had the second highest 737flight cycle count in the world, with nearly 90,000 in total. That's way more than it was designed for. This led to fatigue, cracking, corrosion, and the eventual explosive decompression. So, planes are pressurizedto the least extent possible to minimize stresses andextend the life of the plane. But even 75% of atmospheric pressure should be plenty to preventthe doors from opening. So, how did this happen in May, 2023? A passenger panickedand actually managed to open an Airbusemergency exit in flight. They were on final approach and they were quite close to the ground, so the pressure differentialwas very little. And because of him using all of his force, he actually managed to getthe door open, which was crazy and we didn't thinkthat that was possible. But if you want somethingbad enough, I guess it is. Wow. Was he okay? He was okay. Everyonewas okay in that case. That was a pretty serious mishap. So, I guess the next logical question is: Have any other passengersinadvertently caused a mishap, by say, forgetting to puttheir phone on airplane mode? When you're sitting there on the tarmac and they come on and tell you to put your phone onairplane mode, do you do it? And why do they get us to do that? What is the reason? Is there a reason? Obviously, theywouldn't ask you to do it if it wasn't for some benefit. I'm unfortunately a bit of a rebel and I don't follow the rules and yeah. But you're not worriedabout taking the plane down? I'd make sure my parentshave the airplane mode on so I can have it off. I mean, yes I do becauseI don't want it interfering with like the radio or whatever. Well, I think it's thecommunication interference. I feel like I've always been told like it messes up like instruments, but honestly you'realways just told to do it. So you know, just gotta putyour phone in airplane mode. In 1961, the FederalAviation Administration or FAA found that some portable FM radios could interfere withplane navigation systems since they used neighboring radio bands. And out of caution, they banned almost all personalelectronics on flights. But airlines could testany device for interference and overrule the FAA banto allow it on board. Any device, that is, except a phone, because another organizationhas jurisdiction over phones and that's the FederalCommunications Commission, or FCC. See a phone on the ground with buildings and hills around it can usually only seeone or two cell towers at the same time. But from the air, it couldsee 10 or 20 or more. The concern was that 200 phones traveling at 800 kilometersper hour in a plane could rapidly connectto many towers at once, overloading the infrastructure. At least that's what theFCC thought could happen. So, they banned cell phoneuse in flight in 1991. (funky music) But there's a problem with this theory. A plane is a big metal enclosure, essentially a Faraday cage. So, it should block almostall electromagnetic signals. That's why plane antennasare located on the outside. Your phone signals can onlyescape through the windows, which means they go horizontallyout the sides of the plane. So, they would have totravel long distances before reaching the ground. And the cell towers yourphone is trying to connect to, well they are tilted downwards, you know, to collect all the signals from people walking around on the ground. So, it's very hard to makea connection from the air unless you're flying really low. So, phones could only conceivablydisrupt ground networks during takeoff or landing. And the FCC never eventested if this was the case. In 2005, they wentbefore Congress and said the rule banning 800 MHzcell phone use in flight may not be needed in order to protect ground-based cellular networks. As far as we know, a mobile phone has nevercaused an air accident. All airplane mode does forsure is save your battery life. So, why are these rules still around? I've been flying myself and where I've gotten interference, you know, when you'retalking to a traffic control and you get that(imitating a phone signal), you know that signal, and that is because someoneis either using their phone or the phone is on. Will one phone in anaircraft cause any problems? Probably not. Will 200 do something? Maybe. Rather than taking thechance of like, let's everyone update their Twitter profile at 500 feet, rather than saying that, we're saying no, you know, just keep them off, you know, enjoy the Wi-Fi up ataltitude and that's it. But airplane mode mightsoon be a thing of the past. The EU actually no longer requires it and is pushing for airlinesto provide 5G service on all EU flights. So, we may eliminate that inconvenience, but we still have todeal with airplane food. What do you think about airplane food? I only eat the bread rolls. That's only thing I can handle. Apart from that, everythingtastes like mush. It's can be very good.It can be very terrible. Eh, bland-ish, different consistency. Do you think the foodtastes as good in a plane as it would on the ground? No. But bad-tasting food mightnot be all the airlines' fault. See, the air that's pumpedinto the cabin altitude is really dry. And the Sahara Desert for reference has an average relative humidity of 25%, but inside an airplane cabin,it can be as low as 5%. This can dry out your nasal passages, hindering your sense ofsmell and therefore taste. The lower cabin pressurecan also decrease sensations like the intensity of salt and sugar. But there is one flavorthat appears to be enhanced in flight. What do you drink in an airplane? What's your drink of choice? Apple juice. Apple juice? Yeah. Interesting. I mean Coke, that's default Orange or apple juice. Gin and tonic. Maybe a Bloody Mary, but... You're the first one today. Really? Yeah. A German survey of a thousand flyers found that more than a quarter of them order tomato juice in flight. And what's really weird isthat 23% of those people would never drink it on the ground. And would you drink Bloody Mary, would that be like astandard drink at the bar or is it a special plane drink? I only have it on planes. So, why is everyoneordering tomato juice? Well, it could be because of the noise. A 2015 study points to the chorda tympani, a nerve that carries taste information from the tongue to the brainstem. It runs right past the eardrum, between the tiny sound conducting bones. So, loud cabin noise mightunintentionally stimulate it. This could produce an audio illusion that boosts our sense of umami, the savory taste youfind in MSG, soy sauce, and well, tomatoes. I always drink tomatojuice and I never knew why. It just felt like my plane drink. Or like spicy tomato juice- Yeah. Like both of thoseare favorites of mine. Yeah. So, next time you're on a flight, go for something extra sweet or salty or maybe try the tomato juice. I feel like with how much people fly, our perspective of flying is still pretty distorted. So, why is that? Yeah. I know that we talk a lotabout accidents and incidents and we dig into them really, really deep and people might ask, \"Whywould you be doing this? Doesn't that just make peopleeven more afraid of flying?\" But the fact is that thisis one of the prime reasons why aviation is as safe as it is. The fact that we havehundreds of professionals that dig deep into these accidents means that we learn from them. So, every flight becomesa little bit safer. That's actually a big reason that I started my channelMentour Pilot in the first place 'cause I promise you, the more you know the safer you'll feel. (closing music) Do you think that climatechange increases turbulence? Eh, depends on what peoplethink about their opinions. Yeah. It's been a bit of that innews recently, hasn't there? Today, the media tends to prioritize sensationalized headlinesover key details. Part of why airplane mode isstill such a big deal today is because of the media frenzyit started in the 1960s. So it's more important than ever to look at all sides of the story. This is why we specificallyasked Ground News to sponsor this video. Recent stories about theincrease in turbulence come from a 2023 study that suggested a link to climate change. Yet, this study was barelyreported on by the media, totally eclipsed by other major events. But Ground News lets yousee the whole picture. You can easily compare the coverage and verify the source of the information. If you look closer, you'll see that some of the outlets, like The Independent and the SCMP, argue that climate change ismaking flying more dangerous. While others like the FreePress paint a different picture by dismissing the study. That's why it's really important to look at all the information. But Ground News doesn'tonly highlight breaking news on things like science and aviation, they also specificallyshow blind spot stories the media isn't covering. Veritasium is all aboutgetting to the truth and Ground News' mission is to provide all sides of every story, so that we can do that for ourselves.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: Strandbeests"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's a walking skeleton that's powered only by the wind, created by Dutch inventor Theo Jansen. There are no motors and no electronics, and they're made ofthe weirdest materials. Tape and glue and snot and screws, and gets that force to transfer, is really thrilling to me. I mean, now it's on \"The Simpsons.\" The Strandbeest. Uh, is this science or garbage? Dutch art. [Derek] But how do they actually work, and why did he build them? Well, it all started 34 years ago. I promised myself tospend one year on the tubes. That was in 1990. That got totally out of hand. A little. (elegant classical music) [Derek] Now, Jansen's thinking bigger. I hope that that theseanimals can survive all the circumstances here on the beach, like the storms andthe water and the sand. Hopefully at the end ofmy life, it's that far, and that they can live on their own. That's the idea. A new specimen on Earth. [Derek] But to achieve this goal, the beest had to overcomesix major challenges. The first is that they hadto support their own weight. The beginning, I had lots of trouble with the connections, the joints. I used Sellotape to connect them. And it all broke, you know. [Derek] As a result, all the beest could do was lie on its back and move its legs a little. Yeah, I can imagine thefirst thing I would do is stop using tape. (chuckling) Like, tape isnot a long-term solution. Right. Yeah, no, it was very short term. You can look at some of the pictures. It's just like, you see some tubes, but you mostly see tape everywhere trying to hold it together. And so he too realizes this very quickly. So the first fix tothis challenge is, like, using zip ties. Much more elegant, much more clean, way, way stronger. [Derek] Jansen restricted himself to only a few basic materials. Still, five more hurdles remained, the next of which was gettingthe beest to walk smoothly. To do this, Jansen realized that the path traced out by their foot as it moves is extremely important, because if that's wonkyand all over the place, the beest will likely lose its balance. But if instead it tracesout a mostly flat surface along the bottom, well, then the beestcould keep its balance and walk properly. Now, you can get drasticallydifferent footpaths by changing the proportions of these tubes and where they're placed. Some footpaths might be wonky, others a bit flat, or just about anything in between. But how do you find the right one? That's what Jansen wanted to find out. So in 1990, he wrote a computer program that could compute the footpath for any given combination of proportions. Now, you might think, \"Just have the computer go over trillions of possible options and then pick the best one.\" But that doesn't work. Then my computer would be on for a hundred thousand years, yeah. So that's why I use this evolution method where you can come there a lot faster. [Derek] So, Jansen rana simulation that started with 1,500 differentcombinations of proportions, resulting in 1,500 different footpaths. Now, none of these curves had a great flat surface at the bottom, but some were slightlymore flat than others. Those combinations would then reproduce and multiply with slight changes into 1,500 new combinations. This evolutionary process wenton for months, day and night, until, by the end of it, these 13 holy numbers came out. That's how he describes it. They describe the proportionsand placements of all tubes so that when you put them all together and start rotating thecrankshaft right here, they give you this footpath. This is the path that just about everyStrandbeest has traced out for over 30 years. If you then connectdifferent legs together where each leg is out of phaseof the others by 120 degrees, then you get this continuous smooth walk. And those 13 holy numbers? Well, I guess you could see that as the genetic code of the Strandbeest. And the reason youoffset them by 120 degrees is so that there's always feet that are in contact with the ground, which gives you this smooth ride. [Derek] And gettingthis right is important. In 2016, my friend and originalMythBuster, Adam Savage, built his own pedal-powered Strandbeest. I found the movement ofhis robots so compelling, because it felt like lookingat a different kind of nature. There's a tremendous amountof force on the axle, and that he builds allthis stuff with, like, tape and glue and snot and screws and gets that force to transfer is really thrilling to me. To be honest, I builtone at the Exploratorium in their parking lot, over three days, and for two days, I was getting it wrong. [Derek] Adam tried all kindsof fixes to get it to walk, but without success. But I remember building the Strandbeest and hearing this guy talking about somethingI was getting wrong, and I'm tuning him out, tuninghim out, tuning him out. And then at four o'clockbetween days two and three, four o'clock in the morning, I woke up and I was like,(gasps) that guy's right. (both laughing) And he saw it on theinvitation to the build. He saw that I had missed, inmy translation of a drawing, I had missed one of the linkages, and that I had this length of the center triangle linkage off, and I needed to push it out. And it was like night and day. I came in, fixed that thing, cut all the way up themiddle of this metal bod, extended everything by an inch, and all of a sudden it just walked. It was like, when you get itright, that thing just moves. Ah, yes, yes! (whoops and laughs) Did you ever give that guy a heads up and be like, \"Hey, yeah.\" I did, but not till the end of the day. [Derek] Okay. I didn't wanna give him the satisfaction while I was still working. (both laughing) That's my ego. (laughs) [Derek] But Adam's beestlived in an exhibition. (wind and sand whooshing) Jansen's beests, on the other hand, spend the entire summer on the beach, where they're exposed to the elements. So all the remaining hurdles are about surviving andconquering their natural habitat. One major challenge is dealing with sand. [Casper] And the sand is very fluffy, so it's very easy for them to get stuck, especially if it's a stick. It would just bury itself in, and then it cannot move, so it can survive. [Derek] To prevent this from happening, the beests evolved feetspecifically adapted to the beach. What you can immediately see is that it's not just a stickthat's poking into the ground. Instead, you've got thislarge sort of surface area. Then it's much easier for itto stay on top of the sand. [Derek] But they also fulfilla less obvious function. You've got these wires here, and what this does, together away with thelarger surface area, is it provides a lot more contact time where the foot is basicallyin touch with the ground. So, when this foot is intouch with the ground, it can get taken over by anotherand taken over by another. And as a result you getthis very smooth ride, which is what you're looking for, to save the structure of the Strandbeest and not put too much pressure on it. [Adam] Because I builtone with tennis shoes, Theo explained to me that having a couple of inches of play in the linkage between thefinal ankle and the tennis shoe was mission critical to allow that foot to stay in place while the linkage got the otherfoot up and ready to drop. And that's apparentlyhow our walking works is, you know, it's not astraight, like, 1, 2, 3, like a robot. There is the swing, [Derek] But the beestsaren't always walking. I mean, sometimes they'retied up in the same place for days or weeks. And then, sand poses another major threat. If you leave a structurelike this on the beach, you come back after three weeks and it's totally covered with sand. To avoid that, I thought maybe if theyjust lift up a little bit, the sand goes underthere, and that buries. [Derek] This is howflying Strandbeests evolved. But the beests also face moreviolent threats, like storms. So, how can they increasetheir odds of survival during these times? Well, for regular animals, it's typically easier tosurvive harsh conditions by banding together. And the same holds true for Strandbeests. And the idea behind this animal was that they would survivethe storm maybe better holding each other, because if you see anindividual, like over there, if you put it on the beach, it blows over very easy. So as an individual,they wouldn't survive. But as a group holding each other, they are stronger in strong winds. [Derek] This also allows for a different type of Strandbeest One that can be pulled. And the big ideas actuallythat this would be pulled by the other Strandbeest. Now, I asked Theo if I canpull it, and he said yes. So, we can grab it right here. There's some hand markings, and then now I should be the motor, and his crawler should come behind me. So let's see. Oh man, this is cool. This is very cool. Walking a Strandbeest up a Dutch Beach. What an epic job. Strandbeests are ina never-ending battle against the elements. But they can help eachother by working together. Not too long ago, I was inan endless battle myself, with spam callers. And fortunately for me,today's sponsor, Incogni, is helping me in this fight. See, there are data brokers out there that collect all kinds of data on you, like your name, phonenumber, email address, and even your social security number. And then they sell all of this information on the open market, and that's why you canget spam calls and emails from people that you've never even given your information to. Well, Incogni fights the data brokers. You just give them permission, and then they'll figureout who has your data, which laws apply, and then send each broker a letter with all the correct legal terms requesting that yourinformation be removed. To see just how bad the problem is, here's the work Incognihas done for me so far. Back in September, theyhad filed 192 requests. Now, they've filed 260, which in total has savedme over 160 hours of work. So, to try Incogni andfight the data brokers, visit incogni.com/veritasium.

But if too much wind is aproblem, too little is as well. So right now you can actually see one of the current fatalflaws of the Strandbeest. They walk when there's wind, but as soon as the wind dies down, the animal basically dies down as well. And so this is one of the challenges that Theo is actuallytrying to solve right now. Ah, there it goes again. [Derek] This is similar to a challenge that life too has faced. See, you can't always rely on the currents of the wind or water to take you where you need to go. So what you want is to stock up on energywhen it's plentiful, and then use it later when you need it. So you need two things, a way to store energy, and muscles that canuse this stored energy. Now, to collect energy, you've got this sail whichis moved by the wind, and as it moves, it turns this crankshaft, which then pushes this piston here, and it can store pressurizedair in this plastic bottle. Just like a bicycle pump. [Casper] Do you knowsort of what pressures it can go up to? It went up to five yesterday. So, quite a pressure. Wow. They explode whenthere are 10 bars, yeah. Well, once I had a bottle, and there was a a piston in there, and it flew just next to my ear through the window on theback, so it broke the window. So that was quite a happening. Wow. Holy. That's lucky. (chuckling) That's a close call. [Derek] So, now that youhave a way to store energy, you just need a way to use it. (material rustling) And if you connect thepressure with a pump like this, this jumps out. So you have a sort of muscle. Muscle is nothing but an object which becomes longeror shorter on command. So, we have pulling muscles, and the Strandbeest, wehave pushing muscles. [Derek] This hasallowed some Strandbeests to crawl slightly, others to walk bypushing themselves along, and one to wag its tails. One thing you might noticeis that with each challenge, the Strandbeests become moreand more like real animals. It's as if their process is mimicking life and following a similarevolutionary pattern. And in a way, this is true, because they have to overcomemany of the same challenges that animals have had to. And as life evolved, it became more and moreaware of its surroundings. And in at least one case, it became conscious and self-aware. But right now, there isstill one big challenge the beests have to overcome. 'Cause they're blind and deaf, they don't hear very serious, so imagine that you're blind and deaf, you can only feel around somehow. So, one of the challengesthat the Strandbeests run into is that they're walking along the water, and if they accidentallygo in the wrong direction because they're being carried by the wind, then they could end up in the water, and that would be disastrous. So to fix that, Theo hasbeen working on a system that can actually sensewhen it's touching the water and then hopefully, with a connection ofbrain cells and muscles, it can then course correct to go away from the waterback onto the beach. And of course it's important to know that you're close to the sea, right? That's why I have a a water feeler here. Oh, great, can you hold it here? It goes over the ground about this height, and it sucks in air all the time. And as soon as it comes into the sea, it swallows the water and feels the resistance of the water. (machine clicking)It still doesn't work. Well, I must regret- (machine rattling)Oh, now it's working. I'm so happy.(crew laughing) [Derek] But those senses are only useful if you can process those inputs, make a decision on what to do, and then issue that to your muscles. Like, when you walk into the water, you should be able to use yourmuscles to correct course. So what you need is a nervous system, a sort of brain, if you will. This is a nerve cell. If I take the top off and if I blow air in here, the air goes in here and comes outta here. So this is a connection. But if I push in thispiston here, it's blocked. So in fact, which you seehere is only a crank here, only a valve. Open, close, right? Now I go to operate thecrank here, this air. So if I blow air in here, this closes, and no air comes outta here. If you see this as the output and this, the input, the output is opposite from the input. (upbeat music)(graphics beeping) In other words, you canswitch zeros and ones just like in a computer. So what you see here is the beginning of thebrain of the Strandbeest. Do you have an idea howmany brain cells you'd need to be able to make that work so the animal walks into the water and is able to turn around? 20, something like that. Wow. Yeah. It's not very complicated. Yeah. The only thing is, here on the beach, everything is complicated, because sand creeps into everything and so, yeah, it's not an easy thing, no. (gentle music) [Derek] Over time, thebeests also slowly degrade. They lose their color,and parts might break off. On the scale of the globalmicroplastic pollution problem, this effect is small, butit's certainly not helping. Fortunately though, almostall parts of the Strandbeests are reused, sold as fossils, or they end up in the graveyard. It's crazy to think that allof this has been made possible by the obsession of one guy tinkering away year after year. But why did he do it? During the late 1980s, it was becoming clear thatrising levels of carbon dioxide would warm the planet, and therefore sea levels would rise by as much as 2.2 meters by 2100. And about a third of Jansen'shome country, the Netherlands, lies below the current sea level, so rising sea levels posea clear and present threat. So Jansen came up with a solution. He imagined this sort ofwalking skeleton on the beach. It would be powered by the wind, and it would kick up sand as it walked. Then this sand would blow to the dunes, heightening them and henceprotecting the Netherlands from the rising sea levels. He published this idea in de Volkskrant and called these skeletons Strandbeests. I don't speak Dutch. Strandbeest. Is it the beach beast? Like, what is that? Yeah, perfect. It's the beach beast. (laughs) This is such a wacky idea. I know. Who comes up with that? Theo Jansen. [Derek] What started asan article in a newspaper turned into much more, to the point where it'sbasically defined Jansen's life. So you might ask, is it still really aboutprotecting the Netherlands? And the answer is no, not really. It's about a much more human need that most of us have, the desire to be rememberedafter we're gone. I mean, it's ominous toimagine that we'll die and be forgotten someday, so a lot of us go to greatlengths to avoid this by having kids donatinglarge sums of money to get a building named after you, or writing a book, these sorts of ideas. For Jansen, it's making Strandbeests. And when they fulfill their final goal of living independently on the beach, then, he wrote, \"I candie with peace of mind.\" The only thing is, I don'thave millions of years. There's the problem a bit. But maybe I can hypnotizesome young people around here. There were some people whowere really very, very nice, and they help me a lot, so I might be able to infect them with this Strandbeest virus Because people all over the world are actually using this as well, so, like, the virus isspreading, in a way, or whatever you want to call it. [Derek] Thousands ofpeople all over the world are incorporating his 13 holy numbers into their own designs. From miniature Strandbeests,to ones you can ride, to a walking bicycle. The genetic code of the beests is spreading all over the world. He wants everyone to build one of these, but I don't think he'sgot any ulterior motive except that he likesseeing those things go. And when he makes them go, he has a set of rules and restrictions, but he doesn't place those samerestrictions on anyone else. I think that's really beautiful. And who knows, perhaps one day they'llachieve that ultimate goal. A new species on earth, roaming the world's beaches, kicking up sand all along, and maybe even protecting some coastlines from rising sea levels.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: audio illusions"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "and decide which is higher. So this is sound A. (sample sound buzzing) And this is sound B. (sample sound buzzing) Okay, so to me, sound A is clearly higher, but that's strange because sound A was justa 100 hertz sine wave. Sound B had that same 100 hertz frequency, but also 150 hertz and 200 hertz. So we added higher frequencies,but the sound was lower. How does that work? I think there's this idea that what our ears do is simplydetect the frequency of vibrations in ourenvironment that are between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz. But there is so much moreto hearing than that. And in this video, we'regonna go through a series of audio illusions thatillustrate how our sense of hearing actually works. Most of these effects will work on a phone or laptop speakers, but if youhave headphones handy, well, I'd recommend putting themon for the full experience. It's like a whole bodyinstrument, isn't it? Absolutely yeah, yeah. This is the Sydney Town Hall pipe organ. When it was built in 1890, it was the largest organ in the world. Something I didn't realize about organs is that they were meant tosound like many different instruments playing together. Organs are sort of aone person orchestra. Very flutie, right? Yeah.- You can tell. Compare that to a trumpet. Oboe sound. So you can hear all theseorchestral sounds on the organ. We could get inside the instrument too. Should we go look? Let's have a look. Yeah. Okay. For each instrument,there are a series of pipes in the organ which play all the different notes for that instrument. I mean, there are 8,000pipes in this organ. 8,000? 8,000, yeah. Why do you need that many? To create all the differentsounds of the orchestra. What you see on the outsideis just a tiny fraction of the organ itself. Whoa look at all these.They're all hidden in here. [Titus] They are, yeah. And some are wooden, some are metal. Some have resonators at the bottom of them to create the more reedysounds, the brassy sounds. But then these wooden ones are more of the deep flutie sounds as well. This is like what a keyboard? It's a keyboard. Yeah, that's right. A keyboard layout of pipes. Very nice you position yourself well... When two pipes of thesame length vibrate, they both play the same note. That's because they're bothproducing the same fundamental frequency that is the lowest and usually highest amplitudevibration they produce. But if the pipes are madeof different materials, they will sound different. So you can tell they aredifferent instruments, and that's because eachone produces a distinct set of higher frequencies called overtones. They're not as loud as the fundamental, and we don't hear them as distinct tones, but they affect the qualityof the sound called timbre. It's how you can tell apart a trumpet from say a flute. They have overtones ofdifferent frequencies and relative amplitudes. For a lot of instruments, the most common overtonesare integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. These are known as harmonics. If this was your fundamental note, the notes that you're gonnabe hearing with it would be... So all of those notes arewithin that fundamental note. Now, harmonics can beuseful when you're trying to play really low notes. The Sydney Town Hall pipe organ is one of only two in the worldthat has a 64 foot long pipe. It's actually so large that it has to be folded over itself. Where is the 64? Can we see it? You've got the grand question that I don't know. I know it's somewhere here. Like that's a really bigchunk of wood right here. Oh, yeah. Could that be it? This pipe is used to producea frequency of 8 hertz. When you get to thatlevel, it's more something that you feel rather thansomething that you hear. For sure. The lowest note most bigpipe organs can play is 16 hertz, which is just atthe limit of human hearing. But even this requires a 32foot pipe, which is too big or expensive for many organs. Do you know where the 32 footers are? Well... They're ones out the front? They're the ones thatyou see at the front. That one. That's the 32 footer.- Yeah. So that's nearly 10 meters. Nearly 10 meters. Yeah. It's pretty scary to think about from the top of it actually. In 18th century Europe, Georg Joseph Voglerwas a popular organist. He wanted to tour the continent, but that would require buildinga compact portable organ that he could take with him on the road. And we obviously couldn't haul around the huge 32 foot piperequired to produce 16 hertz. So how could he stillcreate the low frequencies that make the organ so powerful? Well, Vogler realized thatif he played the harmonics of 16 hertz using shorter pipes, your brain would hearthis missing fundamental. Can we try the trick and see if it sounds?- Yeah, sure. The fifth is that sort ofmost common fundamental, which you're gonna hearto get the low sound, but basically the quintgets used with a 16 foot and it creates the lower resultant tone. So that's just the 16 metal. It's so funny because you add it and I do not hear it going up. You're playing a fifth above. Yes- But I'm hearing it go down. Like you just pull that out and I'm like, oh yeah, the note dropped. That's the trick. Yeah. With the two sounds Iplayed at the beginning, the first was a pure 100 hertz. (sample sound buzzing) But the second sound was made up of the harmonics of 50 hertz. (sample sound buzzing) So you actually heard thisfundamental frequency, even though it wasn't there. That's how higher frequenciestogether can sound lower than low frequencies if they areharmonics of a low fundamental. Now, this might not beas weird as it seems. If you look at the waveform of the harmonics, you find that addingthe higher frequencies changes the period of the sound. It makes the period longer sothat it's actually the same as the missing fundamental. If you kind of recreate someof those harmonic pitches, you're actually gonna bringout more bass in the sound. So, the idea of like youcould play the harmonics and hear the fundamental even if you're notplaying the fundamental. That's right. Yeah. So different frequency sounds can combine to make notes that aren't there, but they can also dosomething, even stranger. Hello, it's me, Mario. In Super Mario 64, there's a staircase that seems to go on forever. Players can't level up untilthey collect enough coins. Now listen carefully to the music. The scale sounds likeit keeps going up and up and up, just like the endless staircase. This is the Shepard tone illusion, and here's a Shepard Glissando on its own. (music escalating) An ever increasing toneshould be impossible because we can't hear anything beyond the 20,000 hertz limit, and yet this sound keepsgoing, always ascending. The trick is a Shepardtone isn't just one note. There are multiplefrequencies being played, all separated by octaves. All of these frequencies are increasing, but as they do, their volumes change. So the high notes get quieter,and the low notes get louder. High notes soon fade out, andnew low notes are faded in. This gives the illusionof an ever rising pitch, like the audio versionof a barbershop pole. Shepard tones can also evoke emotional or physical responses in some listeners. A 2016 study found that after listening to Shepard tones, participants reported feeling nervous, anxious, and disturbed. Perhaps that's why duringan intense bombing scene in the film, \"Dunkirk\"Shepard tones feature in the accompanying score. Hopefully this won't make you uneasy, but I want you to try to figureout which well-known tune, this is, all of the noteshave been kept the same, but they've been mixed upinto different octaves. (sound beeping) Did you recognize the song? Well, here is the unscrambled melody. (sound beeping) But now that you've heard that, can you follow the scrambled version? (sound beeping) To me, it's fascinatinghow the second time I heard the scrambled melody,the tune seemed obvious, which is very different fromhow it sounded the first time. Our brains can find patternsin random sounds too. This is the phantom word illusion created by Dr. Diana Deutsch. Listen to this audio and try to figure outwhich words are being said. You can put what youheard in the comments. When one speaker plays a word, the second speaker plays a different word at the same time. According to Dr. Deutsch,because the signals are mixed in the air before they reach your ears, you're given a pile of sounds to choose from, so you cancreate words in your mind. A lot of what we hear dependsnot on the frequencies of sound, but on howour brains process them. Dr. Deutsch noticed that whenshe played this illusion near exam week, students reportedhearing words like, \"No brain,\" \"I'm tired,\" or \"No time.\" And we can actuallyprime the brain to hear what we want it to hear. For example, using text. Take the case of this crowd chanting. (crowd chanting) You're primed to hear the lyrics you see. These are called Mondegreens, after a misheard poemin which there's a line, \"They have slain the Earl Amurray and Lady Mondegreen.\" Except in the real poem, the Earl dies alone and his killers actuallylaid him on the green. Sometimes mondegreens happenwhen sounds are divided logically, but incorrectly, such as hearing pullet surpriseinstead of Pulitzer Prize. Language familiarity would help you hear the correct one from the start. So while UK football fansmight hear the common chant that is embarrassing. [Crowd] That is embarrassing. An American football fan might not. What's even more amazing is how subtle visual cuescan affect what we hear. What am I saying in this clip? If you heard the word bear, that's because that's what I was saying. But what am I saying in this clip? Now I bet you heard fair, but if you play back boththose clips without looking, you'll find it's the exact same audio. All we changed was the mouth movement, and I can prove it to you by playing those twoclips at the same time. And what you hear willchange depending on which clip you focus on. So what we see affects what we hear. And the reverse is also true. In this illusion if no sound is played, it looks like the two circles are passing through each other, but ata sound when they intersect (balls dashing) and immediately it seems like they're bouncing off each other. (balls dashing) What we see and hear areintrinsically linked. Because in the real world, one sense can reliably inform the other. But what if there areno visual cues to go on? In the 1950s, air trafficcontrollers were communicating with multiple pilotssimultaneously in the same room. Unfortunately, messages from all of the pilots would playfrom a single loudspeaker, and the overlapping audiomade it really difficult to pick out just one voice. So researchers startedlooking into the so-called cocktail party effect,because this problem resembled focusing on a singlevoice in a noisy room. Most of us can do this withlittle effort, but how? It's kind of like taking the recording of the entire party and pulling out a particular voices waveform. The sound waves interfere with each other before reaching your ears. So this should be a difficult task. In this recording, tryto find the voice talking about a flight in this crowd. (crowd talking) I find that really hard, but if you hear the voicefirst, then the rest of the conversation is easier to follow, (crowd talking) This is much easierbecause you can predict what words will come next based on context and language structure. The second way we can focuson one voice is by identifying where the sound is coming from. Listen again, but thistime focus on the pilot played in your left ear. (crowd talking) In a cocktail party, youcan focus on your friend by ignoring sounds thatcome from other locations. Once researchers realizedthis, they advocated that different pilots be broadcast through different speakers, spread out throughout the control room. This allowed air traffic controllers to more successfullytune in to their pilot. But how do we actuallylocate the source of a sound? Well, I'm gonna put on this blindfold and ask my wife to walk around me and clap in different locations, and I am going to try to pointto the location of the sound. So let's give it a try. Normally you can pinpoint a sound to within a degree or two. And there are actually four different cues that help me identify thelocation of the sound. How is it? The first is volume. A sound on my right willbe louder in my right ear. My head sort of casts a soundshadow over my left ear. And the second cue is thatthis shadow attenuates higher frequencies morethan low frequencies. It's kinda like when yourneighbor is having a party. You can't really hear the highfrequencies like the lyrics, but you can hear the bass because low frequenciesare less attenuated by distance and obstacles. The third is time delay. It takes a sound half amillisecond to cross your head, so sound will usually arriveat one ear before the other. Listen to a beep on your left. (sound beeping) and then on your right. (sound beeping) Now, as the delay betweenthose two beeps is shortened, (ound beeping) it's less of an echoand more just one sound that's really on your left. (sound beeping) The fourth cue we useto identify the source of a sound is at whatpoint in the wave cycle the sound arrives at eachear or the phase of the wave. Is it arriving at a peak or a trough? The phase of the wave at oneear will typically be different than the phase at the other ear. Now you run into a bit of trouble when the sound is either directly in front or behind you or on anypoint in a vertical plane that passes through themiddle of your head. And that's because thedistance from the sound to both of your ears is the same. And therefore, those fourcues aren't very useful. Owls solve this issuewith asymmetrical ears. Their left ear is actually lower on their head than their right ear. So sounds from below arelouder in their lower left ear. Humans typically have symmetric ears, but their shapes are important. This is where the outerpart of your ear comes in. I mean, what we'd normallyjust refer to as the ear. Technically this is called the pinna. Depending on the locationand the frequency of sound, it will bounce off these ridges and bumps on your ear and end up inside your earactually going into the eardrum. And those reflections will actually change some frequencies differently than others depending on the location. Scientists placed tiny microphones inside volunteer's ears to measure this. They could see, for example, that a 6,000 hertz sound located above you might beamplified by 10 decibels, but that same sound belowyou would be attenuated by 10 decibels. These figures depend on the unique bumps and ridges of cartilage in your ear. So each person's ears havea unique response curve to different frequenciesat different locations. And over the course of our lives, our brains learn the waydifferent frequencies reflect off our ears, and we use that information to identify the source of the sound. Now, every person hasa unique pinna shape. So what if our ears changed? In a 1998 study, researchers placed smallmolds into the ears of a group of participants changingthe shape of their pinnas. Here's one subject's data. The rigid background grid represents where sounds were actually played. The dots are the subject's guesses, and the darker warped grid isthe averages of those guesses. Before the study, they werefairly good at locating sounds, but after changing their pinna shape, they were downright terrible. Over a series of days andweeks with their new pinnas, the participants all adjusted and became better at locating sound. So it is something yourbrain can adapt to. Thankfully, after the molds were removed, participants had no trouble reverting back to their original ears. Pinna shape is so key to animmersive sound experience in virtual reality thatcompanies like Apple and Sony actually scan your ears to create personalized spatial audio. And for a long time, peoplehave been trying to harness and amplify our ability to locate sounds. In 1880, professor AlfredMayer presented a device called a topophone tolocate ships in the fog. It was made from twoadjustable hearing cones. By changing the distanceand angle between them, sailors could narrow down thedirection of a ship's foghorn. Unfortunately, they weren't very useful because sound waves interact with fog. But then during World War Ilocating bombing planes on approach was of central importance. So armies developed specialequipment called sound mirrors to amplify sound. In Britain, sound mirrorstations coordinated together to locate an enemy up to15 minutes in advance. But as planes became faster, sound mirrors couldn'tdetect them early enough, and they were eventually abandoned after the invention of radar. But even though thetechnology became obsolete, the system was not. The radar team used thecoordinating station's idea that was first developed fromthe Sound Mirror program. Linked radar stationswere a critical defense in the Battle of Britain. This is the Vox Angelica onthe Sydney Town Hall Organ. When two pipes are slightly out of tune, there's this pulsing effect to the sound. You can hear that in a more pronounced way if I play pure tones. Here is a pure 261 hertz sine wave. (sound beeping) And a pure 263 hertz sine wave. (sound beeping) When both of these tonesplay, those compression and refraction wavesinterfere with each other. Sometimes the peaks line upto produce a louder sound, and when a peak lines up witha trough, they cancel out. Because these frequenciesare separated by two hertz, you hear two louder pulses every second. This is known as beating. (sound buzzing) Now the beats are really clear, and this makes sense when the two waves are interfering in the air. But what happens if a 261hertz tone is played in one ear and a 263 hertz toneis played in the other? (sound beeping) What did you hear? Well, the tones neverhad a chance to interact, but you can still hearsome subtle beating. Your brain is firingat a rate corresponding to the phase differencecausing the beat perception. When your brain mixesthese frequencies together, it's called Binaural Beats. (sound beeping) And maybe you've alreadyheard of Binaural Beats as a quick search of YouTube shows that some people claim theycan improve focus or memory. But a 2023 review was inconclusive and emphasized the need for more standardized testing methods. Audio illusions aren'ta sign that our sense of hearing is faulty. I mean, the world is a messy, noisy place, and our brains havedeveloped complex methods to deal with ambiguity. You fill in the gaps with your past experiencesor expectations. Without your brain making these subconscious adjustments, a cocktail party would alwaysjust sound like a total mess. Audio illusions show us whereour perception goes wrong, but the system as a whole is pretty good at getting to the truth. (static hissing) Now, illusions remind us that we can't always takethe world at face value. And while our unconscious mindsmight fill in the gaps from time to time, it's ourcritical thinking skills that do the heavy lifting ofseparating fact from fiction.

(participant exhales deeply) This is a bucket of cold water. Yep. You're gonna put your hand in and you're gonna keep itin there for a duration that we won't tell you. As it's in the water, you can rate yourdiscomfort on this scale. If basically you're atthe point where, like, \"I am in agony, let metake my hand outta here,\" you can dial it up to that. Oh my God. Yep, can't feel my fingers Stinging.- A bit achey. Arctic.- Painful. Numb.- Numb. Numb.- [Participant] More pain. [Participant] Pain maybe. Pain, can't hold it. And obviously you've got two hands, we'll be doing this three times. I'm replicating an experimentoriginally conducted by Daniel Kahneman andBarbara Fredrickson in 1993. Just as in the original study, I've told participants we'reinvestigating the difference in pain perception betweendominant and non-dominant hands. I'm assuming you're right-handed? Yeah, I'm right-handed.- Okay. But that is not the truepurpose of the experiment. Left-hand in. Yeah, go ahead. Ooh, it's cold. And we've started. Yeah, all the way to the wrist. That's good.(participant exhales deeply) What's the physical sensation like? Cold, (laughs) freezing. Yeah, there's like a point where it almost feels like a muscle cramp. Both numbing and tingling. It is getting colder and colder, yes. [Host] Half of the participantswere randomly assigned to use their left hand first, the other half usedtheir right hand first. They indicated in real time how much discomfortthey were experiencing. It's getting like progressively worse. It feels cold. I wouldn't wanna stay therefor very much very long. Good. Are you from Russia or something? Yes. So you're used to the- I used to cold though. (host laughs) At the end of the trial, I told them to pull their hand out and give an overallrating for the experience. About a seven. Yeah.- Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't wanna swim in that. No. Three.- Seven. Six. [Host] Then they took a 15 minute break before returning tosubmerge their other hand. (intense suspenseful music) Yeah, I can't hold it. [Host] Bet that's real cold, huh? Yeah. I could probably goanother minute, I reckon. What about an hour? No. It's like stinging this time. It started to feel likeI can't feel my hand now. Something like that. [Host] (laughs) Is that agood thing or a bad thing? It's a bad thing, of course. (both laugh) How did that feel? It felt a lot worse than my right hand. (record scratching) [Host] What participants didn't know is that the two trials were different. They started out the same, one hand submerged in14 degrees Celsius water for 60 seconds, and oneof the trials ended there. But the other trial lastedan additional 30 seconds. During that time, the watertemperature increased slightly to 15 degrees Celsius. Have I put it in here for longer than I did last time? Feels like it's been a while. [Host] This increase intemperature reduced discomfort. It seems to make thewater slightly warmer. It's slightly less uncomfortable. [Host] But it was still uncomfortable. This is not the sort of thingyou'd wanna do for hours. No, I would like genuinelyjust be dead right now. (host laughs) [Host] Again, we randomizedwhether the long trial was first or second, and whether it was with theleft hand or the right hand. The ultimate questionwas, \"If I were to ask you to repeat one of those two experiences, which would you choose?\" Probably the left hand, yes. You'd do that first one again? Yeah, I think so. I would say the secondone with the right hand. The first, the right hand. I'll go with the first. The first one?- Yeah. In our small-scale replication, seven out of 12 people saidthey would rather repeat the longer trial. In the Kahneman and Fredrickson study, this preference was even stronger with almost 70% of their participants preferring the longer trial. That is the same trialthat they, in real time, indicated was painful for a longer time. Both trials contained the same 60 seconds at 14 degrees Celsius. The longer trial just addedan additional 30 seconds with the water warming by just one degree. This was still uncomfortableand it was 50% longer, and yet it's the trialmost people preferred. One of the participantsin the original study after reporting that he would prefer to repeat the longer trial muttered, \"The choice I made doesn'tseem to make much sense.\" So the first trial was 30 seconds longer? Yeah, okay. You endured discomfort for longer. But at the end, the discomfortreduced a little bit. And the extra bit is not fun. It's not like the extra bitwas like, \"Oh, this is great. I want to do this.\" If I asked you which trialyou'd want to do again, Probably the first one, You'd tell me the first one.- Yeah. And that's the one that's actually a longer experience of discomfort. Yeah. [Host] As hard as it is to understand, under certain circumstances, apparently, people prefer more pain to less. But why is this? Well, to investigate,Frederickson and Kahneman ran a follow-up studywhere they showed short and long versions of pleasantand unpleasant videos to undergraduate students. Examples of pleasantvideos included a puppy playing with a flower,- [Audience] Aww. [Host] And waves breaking on a beach. While the unpleasant videos included the aftermath of Hiroshima,and a medical film of an amputation.- [Audience] Eww! After the video, students were asked to rate their experience. What they found wasthe length of the video had very little effect onthe retrospective evaluation, positive or negative. Kahneman and colleagues suggestthis is due at least in part to the two different wayswe experience the world. In the moment as the experiencing self, or retrospectively thinking back on events as the remembering self. If you're going throughsomething unpleasant and someone offers you the chance to stop, you, the experiencing self, will likely take them up on the offer. But for the remembering self,the duration of an experience seems to have much less importance. (plane engine revving) This is known as duration neglect. A 2008 study found thatthe length of a vacation did not have any impact on how positively thevacation was remembered. So if the duration of an experience doesn't affect yourmemory of it, what does? (light music) (group laughing) The answer appears to be key moments, particularly ones that elicit the strongest emotional response. As the novelist Milan Kundera wrote, \"Memory doesn't make films, it makes photographs.\" And those photographs usuallycapture the most intense, salient moments of the experience. The most joyful,(child laughing) funny, painful, scary moments in life are the ones that are remembered, and therefore they come to represent the experience as a whole. This is a version of therepresentativeness heuristic, A term coined by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the 1970s. They were studying how peoplethink about probabilities. Consider a family with six children. Is it more likely thatthey were born in the order boy, boy, boy, girl, girl, girl, or girl, boy, boy, girl, boy, girl? For the majority of participants,the first order was viewed as significantly less likely. But in reality, bothorders are equally likely, but boy, boy, boy, girl,girl, girl feels less likely because it seems less random. I mean, people have amental model of randomness, and boy, boy, boy, girl, girl,girl does not fit this model. We rely on representativeness all the time as a mental shortcut, butsometimes it can lead us astray. One famous example developedby Kahneman and Tversky is known as The Linda Problem. Linda is 31 years old, single,outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discriminationand social justice, and she also participated inanti-nuclear demonstrations. So which is more probable? Linda is a bank teller, or Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement? The majority of people who are asked this questiongive the second answer, which makes sense becausethe description of Linda matches our mental model of a feminist. But mathematically, it must be more likely that she's a bank teller, because feminist bankteller is just a subset of bank teller. All feminist bank tellers are,by definition, bank tellers. Stephen Jay Gould said, \"I knowthat the conjoint statement is least probable, yet alittle homunculus in my head continues to jump upand down shouting at me, 'But she can't just be a bank teller. Read the description.'\" The thing about therepresentativeness heuristic, like many heuristics,is that we fall for it even if we are aware thatwe're falling for it. I mean, technically, eggplants, cucumbers, and avocados are all berries, but because they aren't small and sweet like strawberries or blueberries, we don't think of them as berries. An eggplant does not match mypreconceived idea of a berry. So even though I knowit's technically a berry, I'm gonna keep calling it a vegetable. I mean, the salient feature of an eggplant is that I cook it likeI would a vegetable. Also, annoyingly enough, a strawberry is not technically a berry. Botany is confusing. So the representativenessheuristic is why we think that Linda is more likelyto be a feminist bank teller rather than just a bank teller, and why I can't bring myselfto call an eggplant a berry. And representativeness is howthe peak moments in our past come to represent entire experiences. But it's not the only thing that colors our perception of the past. Our brains better recall and therefore assign a greater importance to more recent events. This is known as recency bias. So if you were to listall the meals you had in the last week, itwould be easier to recall the most recent ones. That's why how an experienceends plays an outsized role in how it's remembered. I mean, how many people are rewatching \"Game of Thrones\" right now, for example, compared to, say, \"Breaking Bad?\" I mean, the last season of\"Game of Thrones\" was so awful I don't think I'll everwatch any of it ever again. The end tainted my viewof the whole thing. (wind whooshing) And it seems like that also applies when judging the quality of a life. In a 2001 study, researchers told afictional story about Jen, a never-married woman without children. She's extremely happy. She has a job she enjoys,many close friends, goes on vacations and hasmany fulfilling hobbies. Then she's hit by a car at the age of 30 and dies painlessly and instantly. Taking her life as a whole, how desirable do you think Jen's life was? For the other half of participants, researchers told the same story about Jen, but added another five years to her life. Years that were pleasant, but maybe not quite asgood as the first 30. Then they asked the same question, \"Taking her life as a whole, how desirable do youthink Jen's life was?\" And what they found was thatpeople judged Jen's longer life to be less desirable. That living for those extrafive good, but not great years actually reduced the overallperceived quality of her life. The ending matters. They repeated this same story with a Jen that lives to age 60 compared to age 65, and the results were the same. Adding mildly pleasant years to a very positive lifedoes not enhance it, but actually decreases the perception of the quality of this life. So when it comes to holding your hand in a bucket of cold water, your overall experience of the event boils down to two things,the peak and the end. Oh, yeah. Like, I find that painful. I can't believe people have been, like, standing in front of us acting so tough. Both trials involved holdinga hand in 14 degree water for the same duration. So presumably they createdthe same peak of discomfort. But the longer trial had a nicer ending. Discomfort is backing off. I mean, still uncomfortable, but, like, not quite as uncomfortable. By adding a slightly lessuncomfortable 30 seconds, Kahneman and Frederickson wereable to trick participants into remembering theexperience more fondly. This is clearly a bad choicefor the experiencing self, but a good choice forthe remembering self. This might seem like aninsignificant party trick, but it actually has hugeimplications for our lives. For example, if we remembera medical procedure like a visit to the dentistor a checkup more favorably, we're more likely to do it again, and that improveslong-term health outcomes. At the end of their 1993 paper, Kahneman and Frederickson ask,\"Will a physician be allowed to add an interval of diminishing pain to the end of a medical procedure if the sole benefit of the added pain is to cause the patients to retain a more favorable memory of it?\" In 2003, Kahneman did exactly that. Along with colleagues,he conducted a trial with 682 patients whounderwent a colonoscopy. Half of them went througha normal routine procedure, the other half had an extra three minutes at the end of the procedure where the tip of the colonoscopewas left in, but not moved. So it was uncomfortable, but less painful than therest of the procedure. The patients who experiencedthe extra three minutes of discomfort at the end rated the whole experienceas about 10% less unpleasant. They were also more likely to come back to do a follow-up screening procedure. The peak-end rule also appears in design for customer experiences. The cheap hot dogs at theexit of Ikea are an example. The positive experienceof a cheap, tasty hot dog or ice cream cone leads to a better memory of the whole shopping experience. It's like a doctor giving a lollipop to a child after a checkup. (gentle music) Knowing that this is howthe brain creates memories allows us to create bettermemories for ourselves. If you wanna run more, don't do painful hill sprintsat the end of your workout. Instead, maybe do apleasant cool-down walk while you talk to a friend orlisten to your favorite music. Wanna create bettermemories of your vacations? Making it longer won't matter as much as creating exciting and novel days. Make sure there's a high-peak experience, and also end it with something pleasant. Are you quitting your job and want people to remember you fondly? Well, make sure you areextra nice to your colleagues during your last few weeks. In short, to create bettermemories, you should optimize for the peak and the end. So the best way to close outa YouTube video is, I guess, with a wholesome message. And why not footage of a cutedog playing with flowers? (celestial music) Our mindset plays a huge role in our perception of the environment. And while this makes someexperiences seem more enjoyable, it can also cause us to see things as worse than they really are. But luckily, you can trainyour mind like a muscle to make meaningful improvementsto your day-to-day life. And that's where today'ssponsor Headspace comes in.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: how numeracy (the ability to reason with quantitative information) and political ideology can influence how people interpret data"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "that has been on my mind for years. It shows that there is aparticular type of problem where the smarter you are, the more likely you are to get it wrong. So I asked my American friendWylie to go out on the street and ask people thequestions from the study to see if we could replicate its findings. The first question in the paperis about a fictitious study on skin cream. So in this made-up study, people with skin rashes are assigned to either the experimental group where they use a new cream for two weeks, or the control groupwhere they use no cream for that same period. And at the end, they countup how many rashes improved and how many got worsein each treatment group. The results are summarized in this table. So the question studyparticipants were asked was- Did the skin cream make the rash better or did it make it worse? [Derek] The question is a little tricky because it requiresproportional reasoning, I think better. Better? So what are you looking at? Just real quick. I'm gonna be honest. I'm just looking at howbig the numbers are. [Derek] If you just lookfor the biggest number, well that is the groupwho used the skin cream and the rash improved. So this number isbigger than this number? Yeah.- Yeah. So you might concludethat the cream worked, it makes rashes better. That is the intuitive answer. But if you look more carefully at the data and use proportional reasoning, you realize that in theexperimental cream group, about three times as manypeople got better as got worse. But in the control group, around five times as manypeople got better than worse. So using no cream, your rash was significantlymore likely to improve. In fact, it's a fair conclusion to say that the cream, onaverage, made rashes worse. The lead author on thisstudy was Dan Kahan. I'm Studying the scienceof science communication. He and colleagues recruiteda nationally diverse sample of 1,111 Americans to participate. But before answering thequestion on skin cream, each participant was askeda series of questions to assess their numeracy. And numeracy, it'snot so much the capacity to use complicated mathematics, but really to reason wellabout quantitative information. Numeracy scores for theentire sample were roughly normally distributed. Now if you group togetherall the participants with a certain numeracy score, say group all the zerostogether, all the ones together, all the twos and so on. Well, what fraction of each group do you think got the skincream question right? Well, the results areexactly what you'd expect. Oh, this is math. It's math. In a fifth of the people, which is a smaller number-- Uh-huh. The rash worsened, sothe skin cream didn't help. So it didn't make it better?- I feel the cream, if anything, made it worse. [Derek] The higher the numeracy score, the greater the fraction of participants who got the answer right. Yeah. I don't think thenumbers mean anything to me 'cause I think I need-- That's a perfect answer. I think I would needto know what's the rash and what's the cream you're giving me. [Derek] Those withbetter numeracy skills manage to avoid theintuitively correct answer. What are the-- Just seems like proportions. I've had nobody get intothe numbers like this. This is great. Excellent. You got that right.- Okay. And correctly determine that the cream actually made rashes worse, which is no big surprise. But this version of the skincream question was only shown to some of the participants. Another subset saw the same exact table except the column headings were reversed. So in this case, the skin creamdid make the rashes better. So how did the differentnumeracy groups do with this version? Well, again, the highest numeracy groups were the most likely toget the correct answer. But below a numeracy score of five, the results were pretty flat. That could be because evenwithout any numerical reasoning, most people might expect askin cream to improve a rash, which just happens to be theright answer in this case. But the true purpose of thestudy was not to find out how numeracy effects our ability to reason accurately with data. No, it was to figure out if something else affects our reasoning ability. Specifically, politics. (exciting music) If you look at the skin cream data again, but separate the participants by their self-reportedpolitical affiliations, so liberal Democrats versusconservative Republicans, there's basically nodifference between the groups. All follow the same patternirrespective of party, which makes sense because astudy on skin cream is about as apolitical as it gets. But what the researchersdid with the other half of the participants was the opposite. Instead of skin cream, they presented a fictitiousstudy on gun control. In case you don't know,Democrats generally believe that gun control reduces crime, whereas Republicansbelieve it increases crime because it takes guns outtathe hands of good guys who could prevent or deter crime. So in their made-up study, the cities were divided into two groups, those that had recentlyenacted legislation making it illegal tocarry a concealed handgun and similar cities thathad no such legislation. Over the following year,crime rates were monitored to see where crime increasedand where it decreased. And the results aresummarized in the table. Again, no surprise, it's exactly the same as the skin cream example. Of course, there were two variations, one where gun control decreased crime and one where it increased crime. Now if you look at theresults by political leaning, they paint a very different picture. It's kind of obvious, ifyou have guns in a city, people are gonna start shooting people. And you know, if you don't have guns and you outlaw them, cities are obviously gonnahave less crime in 'em. But the thing is, it's like you can't just take people's guns awayand say that they're illegal. You know, like that's just,it's kinda like drugs. So wait, but these numbers though, how did you just come to that conclusion? [Derek] When Republicansare shown the table where the correct answer is guncontrol laws increase crime, then the accuracy improves with increasing numeracy, just as before. But for the Republicanswho are shown the table where gun control decreases crime, well, numeracy skills nolonger affect accuracy. Those with a numeracy score of seven or eight are barely morelikely to answer correctly than those with a score of zero or one. So where the crime improved,like there can be crimes that were prevented becausethe guns were legal. And the crimes that were worsened, that could have been othercrimes like not related to guns, you know?- Mm-hm. And the same is truein reverse for Democrats. The more numerate people inthis sample have no problem recognizing the correctanswer when it shows that gun control reduced crime. But, if the data showed thatgun control increased crime, then all of a sudden numeracy didn't help. Remember, this is the exact same data and question as the skin cream example. The only difference is now that data is presentedin a political context. And the biggestdifference in performance is among the most numerate people, they're scoring a lot worsethan they should have. The low numeracy people areabout 25 percentage points less likely to get the right answer if that answer is threateningto their ideology, than if it's consistentwith their ideology. The people who are high innumeracy, on the other hand, 45 percentage points lesslikely to get the right answer. Rather than using theirmathematical ability to come to the correct conclusion, they somehow selectively apply it to justify the conclusion theyalready believed beforehand. Illegal guns, less crime. Illegal crime.- Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't have thought that. And as numeracy increases, people are more divided about the efficacy or the risks of gun control regulation. The same thing with fracking, and same thing with global warming. We see the polarizationconditional on numeracy, but we also see the same effect when we measure people'sreasoning proficiency in other ways. The people who are highin science literacy, more polarized thanthe people who are low. The people who are high andactively open-minded thinking, you see more polarization, not less, as they become more proficientin this kind of thinking Based on this data, ofcourse I'd wanna look into it and look at all the sources. And of course there aresources from sources because people are alwaysciting each other, so yeah. This is, the numbers areactually not real whatsoever. It looks, but, if I were tolook at this pragmatically, I would just say that the playing fieldseems pretty even here. It's pretty even?- Yeah. Okay, great. Now, everyone wants tobelieve that they are rational, that they could change their beliefs in light of the evidence. If you encounteredevidence on a political issue that you were like,\"This is good evidence. I've done my research.\" But it contradicted yourpolitical belief on that issue, how would you react to that? I'd consider myself tobe a little bit open-minded in that aspect. At least be open to learning. Yeah.- If it's on paper and that's the way it is, Iwould have to go with that. I'm gonna have to deal with it. I can't be like, \"Well, Ifeel like it's different.\" All I see here arepeople who will continue to hold partisan beliefsregardless of the evidence, all the while deluding themselvesinto thinking they came to these beliefs via an independent, sober consideration of the facts. The truth is that mostlywe believe what we believe to fit in with our tribe. And that, in the most importantway, is highly rational. Because humans are very social creatures, and for most of our evolution, we've depended on each other for survival. Being ostracized from thegroup is almost as bad as walking off a cliff. If we question the status quo by rejecting what those around us accept as true, we jeopardize our place in society. Man, I've learned thatpeople are not as dissimilar as we think. That there is so manysimilarities between sides that we think share nothing in common. I attended Zoom meetingsin the opposite party and it was kind of scary because they sounded just like my side. It makes you think aboutwhat we could get done if we didn't have that burden, and I think it would bea pretty different world and pretty extraordinary ifwe managed to figure that out. So what do we do about this? Well, I don't think thereis an easy solution, but Kahan has identified afew angles that might work. One is avoiding partisan rhetoric. Rather than talk about guncontrol or climate change, avoid the loaded terms and instead focus onspecific local policies. No buzzwords that could triggeranyone into tribal thinking. No villainizing the other side, just constructive solutionsthat make sense given the data. One example comes from southeast Florida where a bipartisan group oflawmakers have joined together to take action on sea-level rise. The plans don't debate whether climate change is manmade or not. They just deal with existingchallenges faced by residents. The other thing is tofoster a curious mindset. Maybe the science curious people, they're more willing toexamine all the evidence, including information that's inconsistent with their political ideology. With increasing science comprehension usually comes increasingpolarization on political topics. But with increasing science curiosity, this same increase inpolarization is not observed. That is a start. I am not going to claimto have the solution. Problems of this sort are likely as old as the human species itself. They are just much more obvious now that everyone can post, tweet, comment and basically shout loudly into this nearly infinite digital space. The only thing I hope todo is bring some awareness. The beliefs of most people are not formed by a careful consideration of the data. That includes me, and itprobably includes you. Acknowledging this isan important first step. (bright music) One organization that istrying to tackle polarization and our information echochambers is Ground News. So we specifically askedthem to sponsor this video because they gather news sources from around the world in one spot and show you any politicalleaning they have. That way you can read about the same issue from different perspectiveswith the context needed to separate facts from politics. For instance, the FBIrecently released statistics about violent crime in the US. This is a key political issue that was referenced inthe presidential debate. Most left-leaning outletsfocused on the 3% drop in violent crime. Some use this to counter Trump's claim that crime is on the rise. However, right-leaning sourcessuggested crime increased under Harris and Biden inline with Trump's statements. So how can we have such a disagreement? Well, Ground News lets us dive deeper into the reporting to uncover that right-leaning sources referenced a completely differentreport, a DOJ survey. And this survey collected data differently and crucially, couldn'tinclude fatal crimes, while the FBI statistics did. Similarly, the FBI statistics couldn't include unreported crimes while the DOJ survey specifically does. So we're comparingapples and oranges here, which is the source of the disagreement. This kind of critical thinking is crucial to keeping our biases in check and so is personal accountability.

(Derek speaking in foreign language) 13.- 7. 37.- 37? 73.- 37. 35.- 37. [Emily] 37, no way! 43.- 2. 37. (Derek gasping) I knew you were gonna do it. He just \"37-ed\" and walked away. Between 1 and 100. Ah, no thanks.- [Emily] Okay. 37. [Emily] Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. 83.- 37. 37. 87.- 55. 37.- 37. (Emily gasping) Can I shake your hand? [Derek] I love the thoughtyou're putting into this. 37?- No, you are kidding me! Are you real?- Yeah why? Did we ask you this already?- No. Random number between 1 to 100. 37.- 37. Oh, my gosh, yes. [Derek] Name a randomnumber between 1 and 100. 37.- Are you kidding me? Why? It's a good number, I guess, any number. [Derek] Where did that come from? Imagination, I suppose. So, what's going on? Well, people are actually really bad at selecting things randomly. In fact, when asked topick a color and a number, people reliably select blue and 7 the most across dozens of different cultures. Psychologists have aname for this pattern. The blue-seven phenomenon. And when picking a randomnumber between 1 and 100, it has long been suggested that the equivalent ofthe blue-seven phenomenon is the number 37. My producer, Emily, and Ispoke to hundreds of people to test this theory. The most common answer was 7, but maybe that's becausepeople just expected that we'd ask them fornumbers between 1 and 10. The most common two-digitnumber really was 37, much to our surprise. (Derek and Emily gasping) So we decided to embark onthe biggest investigation ever on the number 37. And it took us to some unexpected places. I think 37 is a fascinating number. It's just really interestingbecause it turns up so much. How many objects are therehere in the room with us that have a 37 on them? I'm sure there's more than 1,000 here. I built the 37 Website in 1994. I started getting email fromstrangers, it's everywhere. I'm trying to collect them all. We're tireless. The tireless cabal of 37 people, yeah. Apparently, people choose 37 so reliably that there's even a widespreadprofessional magic trick that relies entirely ongetting an audience member to just pick 37 out of thin air. It's called The 37 Force. I'm gonna ask you to thinkof a number in a moment, okay? It's a two-digit number, less than 50. Both numbers are odd, but different. You could have 19, 17, or 15, but not 11. Because you see both numbers are the same,1 and 1 next to one another. You ready? One, two, and three. What number did you think of? [Audience] 37.- 37. Fascinating. In the famous Stanford MIT Jargon File, the origin of hacker slang, 37 is given as the random number of choice for computer programmers. \u201cWhen groups of people are polled to pick a random number between 1 and 100, the most commonly chosen number is 37.\" (graphic buzzing) The thing is, no formalpolls on this actually exist. The best we found was aReddit poll of 1,380 people from four years ago, and the most popular number was... 69. But after that, the winning number was 37. But we can do better than a sample size of just 1,000 people. So we conducted the largestrandom number survey ever. In a community post 3 weeks ago, we asked people to pick arandom number between 1 and 100. We received 200,000 responses. Here are the results as they came in. It's fascinating to watch how consistent thesesupposedly random numbers are, from 10,000, to 100,000, all the way up to 200,000 respondents. The distribution barely changes, suggesting that peoplefrom all around the world think about random numbersin a particular way, and it is decidedly not random. Ignoring the extremes of the scale because people were primed by the numbers 1 and 100in the question itself, and ignoring 42 and 69because they're not random, there are a few numbers that stand out, which we seem to regard asmore random than the rest. 7, 73, 77, and 37. (pensive music) Then we asked people to pick the number they thought the fewest others would pick. The goal was to get rid offavorite or lucky numbers and give truly random selections. And here, the results were even clearer. Again, ignoring the veryextremes and 50 in the middle, the most selected numberswere, far and away, 73 and 37, which were nearly tied. The actual least-picked numberin the first question was 90, followed by 30, 40, 70, 80, and 60. Multiples of 10 apparentlydon't seem that random. The most picked overallnumbers ignoring the outliers were 73 and 37. (pensive music) Ironically, all this evidence points to 37 and its inversion, 73,as not being random at all. So why does everyone pick them? Well, one argument is that this is just howpeople perceive randomness. 37, does that feel random to you? Yeah. Yeah, it does. [Derek] Yeah, 50 wouldn't be random? No.- [Derek] No. It would be too contrived. [Derek] Yeah.- Yeah, it's too central I think people think that even numbers are less random than odd numbers. 5 feels not random, 9and 1 feel too extreme, so people tend towards 3 and 7. This is backed up by the fact that every one of thetop numbers in our survey consisted of 3s and 7s. In fact, 3 and 7 werethe most selected digits on both questions. But there's also a mathematical case for humanity's number of choice because it's not just odd numbers, but specifically primes, which feel like the most random numbers. Notice how we ignore odds ending in 5s or how something like 39 still feels a little less random than 37? Primes feel random forat least two reasons. First, they don't appearas much in our lives. I mean, pixel counts, fruitboxes, square footage. We live in a composite worldwith multiple dimensions that multiply together, so we just don't see primesmuch past the single digits. Second, we don't havea formula for primes. If you have a prime number and you want to find the next one, you have no choice butto check every number until you find a prime. The closest thing we have to a formula is the prime number theorem, which gives the approximation that the nth prime number occurs around n times natural log of n. For example, the 1,000th prime number should be around 6,908. And it's close, but certainly not exact. So primes essentially occur at random, but of all the primes, 37has reason to stand out. (pensive music) If we were to find the primefactors of every number, we would see that 2 isthe smallest prime factor for exactly 1/2 of them, all of the even numbers. And 3 is the smallest prime factor for 1/6 of all numbers, anything that's divisibleby 3 but not by 2 and so on. As we pick larger and larger primes, they form the smallest prime factor for fewer and fewer integers. But, what if we track thesecond smallest prime factor of each number? Well, first, we have 3, which is the secondprime factor of a number. Only when the number isdivisible by both 2 and 3 or divisible by 6. So 1/6 of all numbers havea second prime factor of 3. And as we keep going, which number will end upat the balancing point? This is the median secondprime factor of all numbers, all numbers from 1 allthe way up to a googol and off to infinity. Would you believe that that number is 37? (pensive music) Let's take a look at 5. 5 is the second prime factor only when a number isdivisible by 5 and 3, but not 2. Or 5 and 2, but not 3. In the first case, anumber divisible by 5 and 3 means it's divisible by 15, so that's 1/15 of all numbers. But it also can't be divisible by 2. So 1/2 of 1/15 is 1/30 of all numbers. In the second case, a number divisible by 5 and 2 means it's divisible by 10, but it cannot be divisible by 3. So we're left with 1/10 times 2/3 equals 1/15 of all numbers. Adding up these two cases, we get that 1/10 of all numbers have 5 as their second prime factor. And we can repeat thisfor the next prime, 7. Just take each of these cases and add them up to getthat 1/15 of all integers have a second prime factor of 7. And so on. Keeping a running total, we quickly approach a balancing point for the second primefactor across all integers. And then we reach it. So the median second primefactor of all numbers is 37. Half of numbers have a secondprime factor of 37 or less. There are other remarkablequalities about 37 as a prime. It's an irregular prime, aCuban prime, a lucky prime, a sexy prime, a permutableprime, a Padovan prime. And at this point, mathematicians might just bemaking up types of primes. 37's identity as aprime number is so strong that the same day I firstlearned the number 37, I learned it was prime. This was one of my firstbooks as a toddler. It teaches you every number from 1 to 100 with a short story or fun fact for each. So for 26, that's how manyletters in the alphabet. Or for 30, they givethe days of September. Or for 52, that's howmany cards are in a deck. Except 37. (pages rustling)(jaunty music) It's a prime number. Nothing goes into it. Someday, you'll understand. I did not like that. I understood every other number, so I also wanted to understand 37. So, that number has nagged me ever since, and now this video is beingmade some 20 years later. [Derek] Not convinced yet? If you take a number thatis a multiple of 37 already, like 1, 3, 6, 9, that's 37 squared, and then you reverse it, and then you stick a 0in between every digit, then that number is a multiple of 37. And I literally spentthe next month on the bus trying to prove thatfact, which I finally did. Just rattle off a six-digit number. Tell me any six-digit number. 413,625. And it's not divisible by 37. So how did I figure that out? There's a trick for that. Is this your like partytrick that you can bring out? Surprisingly, it doesn't impress as manypeople as you would think. I think it should impress everybody. But there's also a practical reason 37 is an important number for humanity. Say you are faced with a choice that is both immediate and final, like whether to rent theapartment you've just toured or whether to accept ajob offer you received. Or it can be as small as whether to stop the nextgas station on a road trip. These are all problems where you can't assessall the options at once and then decide. With each option you encounter, you need to decide whether toaccept it or reject it forever and see what comes next. In these scenarios, it feels impossible tomake the best choice. If you select too early, you'll probably nevereven see the best option. But if you select too late, well, then you've probablyrejected the best option already. So your best bet issomewhere in the middle. There, you know at least some information from the options you've seen, and you have some choice,to select or pass. But how do you knowexactly when to decide? The optimal strategy looks like this. First, you need to see some options and reject them automatically just to learn what's out there. And then at a certain stopping point, S, you need to stop rejecting them and start evaluating whether an option is the best you've seen so far. If it is, then select it. But when should that stopping point be? We need to work out which stopping point maximizes our chances ofpicking the best option. We can calculate these chances. For each spot, find the probability that the best option is located there times the probability we getthere from stopping point S. Then, add these probabilitiesup across every spot. Now, the chance of the bestoption being in any spot is just random. If there are N options in total, it's 1/N, but it's a little harder to find the chances ofgetting to each spot. Say the best option is inthe next spot after S, S + 1. What are the chances we get there? Well, since this is the next spot over from the stopping point, we have 100% chance of getting there. So we are guaranteed tovisit it and select it. But if the true bestoption is in spot S + 2, well, there's a smallchance we'll miss it. If the best of all the previous options is sitting in spot S + 1, we would just pick that and stop looking before reaching S + 2. There's a one in S + 1chance of this happening. So the chances we do get to spot S + 2 to pick the true bestoption is 1 minus that, or S over S + 1. This same calculation continuesup until the last spot N. We only get here if we've been passingon every option so far, which means that oneof the first S options must have been the best of the total N - 1 options we've seen. In total, this gives us the expression 1/N times 1, + S over S + 1, plusS over S + 2, and so on, all the way up to S over N - 1. Factoring out the S, the sum inside the parentheses approximates the function1/x going from S to N. (pensive music) Taking that integral, we getthe natural log of N over S. So the probability weselect the best option is S over N times thenatural log of N over S. To maximize this probability, we can find the peak of this function by setting its derivative to 0, and this gives the naturallog of S over N equals -1. So S over N equals 1 over e, or about 37%. So explore and reject 37% of options just to get a sense of what's out there, and then pick the firstoption to come along that's better than all ofthe ones you've seen so far. And your chances of successusing this method are also 37%. (pensive music) This math question is knownas the secretary problem or the marriage problem, as it also applies tohiring the best employees or even deciding on the best life partner. Now, it can be impracticalto check 37% of the options because you don't always know how many candidates are out there, but the 37% rule also works for time. So if you want to getmarried, say, in 10 years, then spend the first 3.7years seeing what's out there and then select the next person who's better than anyone you've seen. (pensive music) So 37 is actually important to our lives, and people seem tosubconsciously recognize this. We gravitate towardsthe number everywhere. (pensive music) (film clicking) 37 seconds. 37 years. 37 patties? [Speaker 1] I was 37. [Speaker 2] 37 cubic feet.- [Speaker 3] Take 37. [Speaker 4] 37. How many enemies do you have? 37.- 37! Yes!- [Speaker 5] 37%. [Speaker 6] 37.- [Speaker 7] 37. 37 hours. Destroyed 37 restaurants. 37.- I'm 37. 37 interlocking bronze gears. Page 37. 37 years old. 37 prototypes. 37%. (uplifting music) This collection of images, everything you're seeing onscreen has been collected by one man over the course of his life. And you already know who it is. It's just fun, right? The whole thing is just fun. How many objects are therehere in the room with us that have a 37 on them? This is probably on the orderof four digits, I'd say. There's probably not 10,000, but I'm sure there's more than 1,000 here. Nutri-Grain granola bars, 37 grams. It's a 37-inch yardstick. It's just some politicalcartoon about sports, but there's no reason that guy had to have Jersey number 37. A nail that I found somewherethat has 37 on the head. I don't even know what that means. One time, my mom gaveme $37 for my birthday. They all have 37 in the serial number. Was your 37th birthday likethe greatest birthday ever? I had a big party and Iinvited everybody I knew. The Texas state lottery was $37 million. So I had two different friends who both gave me 37 lottery tickets. I didn't win, I won 5 bucks. This is an article from when they foundthe 37th Mersenne prime. It's just clipping after clipping. How many hundreds of thesedo you want me to go through? I must have gotten that inGermany, but I don't know... But I don't remember what it was. Was it like a locker number? I wouldn't steal a locker number. I've never stolen for 37. (speaker 1 laughing) Look at that. Stolen from the highwaywhen I was on a road trip, [Speaker 1] I heard you say,you never stole anything. I have committed a crime.- [Speaker 1] Yes. There was a bookstore on campus when I was an undergrad at KU, and there were 37 steps in that staircase. Useful facts, these are useful facts. Do you feel like everyonegets 37 this much in their lives or do you feel likeyou're just attracting it? That's a good question. You know, the reason I started was because it seemedlike it turned up a lot. I started back in the '80s. There was a comedy routineby Charles Fleischer, and he went through this sortof litany of coincidences about the number 37, like there are 37 holes in thespeaker part of a telephone. (jaunty music) Shakespeare wrote 37 plays. There's 37 movements inBeethoven's Nine Symphonies. There are all these amazing coincidences that he rattled off. I was amazed and I've beencollecting them since like 1981. Yeah, so 43? 43 years, probably. (jaunty music) I built the 37 Website forthe first time in 1994. I don't know how thewebsite got out there, but somehow it got out there. I started getting email from strangers. I've got... Oh, maybe a half a dozenpeople from around the world, who, every week or month, will post their latest batch of 37s that they've seen out and about. And they've beendoing this for how long? 18 years. Wow.- We're tireless. The tireless cabal of 37 people, yeah. Do you have anything to sayto anyone who might be like, \"37, that's just a base-10representation of that number.\" I am also interested the number 37 in all of its various other forms: Roman numerals; binary numbers 100101, by the way; numbers in any other base. Yeah, 25 in hexadecimal. 45 in octal. And do you think you'regonna keep looking for a 37 and collecting 37 for your whole life? Yeah, yeah, I can'tsee any reason to stop. Yeah, for sure. So maybe there's even something innately universally special about this number. (pensive music) We can argue specialcoincidences for many numbers, but we need to finally addressthe elephant in the room. The sheer amount of brain power 37 secretly takes up inour collective minds. It's humanity's go-to random number, one of our most prominent prime numbers, and most of all, our idealnumber for making decisions. Maybe that's why we'reinclined to it naturally. It feels right to us as whereto settle and what to pick. Though with this video, we may have ruinedrandomness even further. I mean, the next time anyone asks people to pick a random number between 1 and 100, more people than evermight be saying, \"37.\" (pensive music) It's been the story of my life that I intend to takeeverything that I have here and turn them all intoindividual facts on that website. But the website's beenthere untouched for 27 years and it hasn't happened. It doesn't look likeit's ever gonna happen. Maybe on the 37th anniversary,we can get it all done. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. Because I have time to doit between now and then, and that would be... That's a great idea. Once our video comes out, do you want people to write you with any instances they see of 37? You might get swamped, for a little bit. 37 is out there, it's everywhere. I'm trying to collect them all. Bring it. Yes, bring it. (graphic beeping) Our intuition is one of themost powerful tools we have, and the number 37 is just one example of the unseen patterns in our minds.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: Goldbach's Conjecture"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "- [Derek] In Xiamen, China, in the winter of 1954, (fire crackling) air raid sirens (explosions thudding) are sounded all over the city. (siren blaring) People scramble for cover (people screaming) as artillery shells (artillery shells blasting) are being fired in the distance. (artillery shells blasting) The people's Republic of China is bombarding the nearby Kinmen Islands in an attempt to take over control from the anti-communist Chinese. (tank rattling) (boots thudding) But troops on the islands fire back. (artillery shells blasting) Soon, artillery shells are raining down on both sides. (explosion thudding) (siren blaring) (tense music continuing) Back in Xiamen, (siren blaring) Inside one of these shelters is 21-year-old Chen Jingrun. As others are fidgeting impatiently, waiting for the explosions to stop, Chen is reading pages (explosion blasting) from a math book, (pages rustling) because he's on a mission to solve one of the oldest problems in math. (dramatic tense music) - A child can understand the statement, but the greatest geniuses in mathematical history have not been able to solve it. - In the year 2000, a publishing house even offered a $1 million prize to anyone who could solve the problem. But for nearly 300 years, everyone who has tried (dramatic music building) has failed. So the problem is this, can every even number greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes? - So that's the problem. So we can do some examples. (pen cap clicking) We can say, for example, 6. You know that's an even integer. So can we write it as the sum of two primes? So those are numbers that only divide by themselves and by 1. So for 6, it's just 3 plus 3, and we can do more and more numbers. So 10, for example, would be, you know, 5 plus 5, but also 7 plus 3. There's one I want to do, one extra, which is your favorite number. - 42. - 42. What makes it up? - 37 and 5. - 37. Yeah. But there's also a, sort of, nicer, more methodical, way of writing this out, and it will help us (paper rustling) build some intuition. - [Casper] We'll start by drawing two diagonal lines. (soft inquisitive music) - I'm building like a pyramid. A pyramid of prime numbers. (pen cap clicking) - [Derek] All right. - [Casper] So, we're gonna start at the top. We're gonna write down 2. Then we'll write down 3. 5. And this is gonna be a good test of how well I know my primes. Then we'll do the same on the other sides. Okay, and now, what we're gonna do is, we're gonna draw a line from each prime. Can you see where this is going? - [Derek] And where they cross is every sum? - [Casper] Yeah. Now I can start adding them. So we get 2 plus 2. - 4. - [Casper] 4. 3 plus 3. - 6. - 6. You can see, we're starting to get all these numbers. The main point here is just, as you go down, not only do you see all the even numbers appear, but they also seem to appear more frequently. And it seems like it should always happen. And, of course, the conjecture is that it does always happen, and that's known as the gold Goldbach's conjecture. - [Derek] Chen's obsession (mysterious gentle music) with the conjecture goes back to his high school years, when his teacher stood in front of the class telling the students all about the sciences, and said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences. Number theory is the queen's crown. And the Goldbach's conjecture is the pearl on the crown.\" (soft music continuing) - Shortly after, the teacher said, \"Well, perhaps, one day, one of you kids will solve it.\" And then the whole class burst out laughing. (people laughing) Everyone except for Chen Jingrun. (inspiring classical music) He later said, \"I did not laugh. I did not dare to laugh. I was worried my classmates would know my vision, but I never forgot this lesson to always remember the pearl on the crown, and to never forget my aspirations or ideals.\" - [Derek] And now, (alarm blaring) as air raid alarms are ringing, he's maintained his vision. (alarm blaring) He's working on his math, trying to solve Goldbach's conjecture. - And then it's like, well, who the hell is Goldbach? (playful classical music) Do you know a Goldbach? - I know nothing about Goldbach. - Christian Goldbach is a little known Prussian mathematician who grew up in the early 1700s. At first, (paper rustling) he mostly studied medicine and law, only occasionally dabbling in mathematics. But then in 1710, at the age of 20, he set off on a 14 year, and over 4,000 kilometer long, journey to meet some of the greatest mathematicians alive. (playful classical music playing) In Leipzig, he met with Gottfried Leibniz, the co-inventor of calculus. And, in London, he met with both Nicolaus Bernoulli, and, perhaps the greatest mathematician of all time, Sir Isaac Newton. (classical music continuing) He then finished this trip around Europe before ultimately settling down in Russia at the newly formed St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. (waves crashing) (seagulls cawing) Where, in 1727, he met his most important connection, No text a 20-year-old math prodigy. Can you guess who? - Leonard Euler? - Leonard Euler. (both laughing) - The two quickly became friends, bonding over a shared obsession with number theory. Then, in 1729, Goldbach moved to Moscow, but the two stayed in touch, writing letters to each other for the next 35 years, literally until Goldbach died. (tense fast music playing) (wind whooshing) It was in one of these letters, (paper rustling) on the 7th of June, 1742, where Goldbach scribbled a line in the margin. It was not the exact form of the conjecture which now bears his name, but something related. (wind whooshing) \"It seems that every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of three primes.\" (slow classical music) Euler was intrigued by the proposition, but he thought the idea could be refined further. It made sense to him that odd numbers might need three numbers to add together to make them, but then he turned his attention to even numbers, and he thought, \"Well, with even numbers, perhaps just two prime numbers would be enough to sum to give you every even number.\" In fact, as Euler wrote in his letter, this is how Goldbach originally framed the problem in person. So, Euler reformulated Goldbach's idea (wind whooshing) into two separate conjectures. (wind whooshing) The first dealt with odd numbers, and said, \"Every odd number greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes.\" This became known as the weak Goldbach conjecture. And the second (wind whooshing) dealt with even numbers. It said, \"Every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes.\" This became known as the strong Goldbach conjecture. (wind whooshing) (playful gentle music) They get their names strong and weak conjecture, because (wind whooshing) if you have the strong conjecture, then you've shown that every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of just two primes. And then you can add three (wind whooshing) to each of those sums to get all of the odd numbers. So if you can prove the strong conjecture, you get the weak one for free. But the reverse is not true. If you can prove the weak conjecture, you still don't get the strong one. Now, after Euler reformulated these conjectures, he was so confident they were true, that he wrote, \"I regard this as a completely certain theorem, although I cannot prove it.\" - And he couldn't, you know? And for the next 150 years, almost no progress is made. (cymbals crashing) - [Derek] That is until, in 1900, German mathematician David Hilbert addressed the International Congress of Mathematicians, No text in Paris. (paper rustling) And there, he listed 23 of the most important problems for the 20th century. (pages rustling) Number eight on that list was all about prime numbers, including Goldbach's conjecture. (pen scratching) - Goldbach's conjecture was back on the radar. Only now, mathematicians started to look at the problem differently. (gentle inquisitive music) - [Derek] Let's take a look at our pyramid again. One thing to notice is that this pyramid is symmetrical. When two primes add to make an even number on the right side, those same two primes make an even number on the left side. So, to avoid double counting, we can look only at the right side of this center line. And what we find is that for very small even numbers, like 4, 6, or 8, well, there's only one way to write them as the sum of two primes. But for larger numbers, like 20, well, now there are multiple different ways to write it as the sum of two primes, and the further down you go, the more combinations you find. - So, mathematicians started asking a new question, not just whether every even number can be written as the sum of two primes, but in how many different ways it can be done. - [Derek] Let's call that number H of N. For example, H of 4 is 1, because you can only write 4 as the sum of primes 2 plus 2. H of 20 is 2, because that is 3 plus 17, and 7 plus 13. H of 42 is 4, and so on. (bubble popping) Now, so far, we're just counting up what the value of H should be. But in 1923, two English mathematicians, G. H. Hardy and John Littlewood, tried to come up with a function that would estimate H of N. To do it, they relied on one of the most important results from number theory, the prime number theorem. (harp chiming) (bright classical music) This tells you that, on average, a large number in the neighborhood of N, has 1 over the natural logarithm of N chance of being prime. So here's a crude version of what Hardy and Littlewood did. They imagined this large even number, and they said it equal to 2N. So you could split it right down the middle at N. Now they considered a pair of numbers, A and B, that together add up to 2N. Where A is smaller than N, and B is larger. They both must differ from N by the same amount. Let's call it C. Now, according to the prime number theorem, the chance that A is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N - C. And the chance that B is prime is 1 over the natural algorithm of N plus C. But here's the trick. - Most of the times we're talking about Ns that are ginormous, that are super, super large. And if you look at 1 over L and N, that function would be something like this. Where, basically, it drops very quickly at the start. And, for large numbers, it's almost constant. So that this C really doesn't affect it a whole lot. So, for most of the numbers, we can, sort of, ignore the C, in both cases, and it becomes much simpler, which is just the chance of A being prime is about 1 over L and N, and the chance of B being prime is about 1 over L and N. Now, what's the chance that both are prime? - [Derek] You're gonna multiply 'em together, - We're gonna multiply them together - [Derek] Still, so far we've just looked at one pair, while, in total, there are about N possible pairs, N ways to add up two numbers to get to 2N. So we can just multiply the chance of one pair being prime with the total number of pairs, to find the total expected number of prime pairs, which comes out to about N over ln N squared. And if we plot this, we find that the expected number of ways to write any number as the sum of two primes increases for larger and larger numbers. - Hardy and Littlewood, they refined this a bit more, but essentially what they find, you know, is the exact same thing. They just have like a correction factor in front, but then this term is still the same. - [Derek] The only problem is that this is just an estimate, not a proof. And as they point out in their own conclusion, \"It is only proof that counts.\" - And that's about as far as they get for the strong Goldbach conjecture. But on the weak one, they have more success. (inquisitive pulsing music) - [Derek] It all comes back to a curious incident 10 years earlier, in 1913. No text We've invited Elmer, from the YouTube channel, Fern, to tell you about it. (tense inquisitive music) - [Elmer] Hardy sits at his breakfast table, when a strange letter arrives. (inquisitive music continuing) It's sent by a completely unknown mathematician from India, (camera clicking) Srinivasa Ramanujan. The letter reads, \"I'm now about 23 years of age. I have no university education, but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school, I've been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at mathematics.\" Ramanujan writes that he's a poor clerk, earning only about 20 pounds a year. He's attached some formulas and is asking for Hardy's opinion. The letter is over 10 pages long and is packed with over 100 theorems, many of them highly advanced, (clicker clicking) yet Ramanujan provides no proofs and very little explanation. Hardy is astounded. He has never seen anything like it. Some are already known, (clock ticking) others are completely new, (clock ticking) unknown to the world. (clock ticking) And then there are results (clock ticking) that seem impossible. (clock ticking) Like that the sum of all positive integers up to infinity is negative 1 12th. How did he come up with this? (shutter clicking) (inquisitive music continuing) Hardy shows a letter to Littlewood. The two stay up until midnight going through the manuscript, debating whether the mysterious author is a genius or a fraud. - But it sounded like Hardy felt these couldn't be crank results because you couldn't imagine them if you were just a crank. They're too fantastical to be the the work of that kind of second rate mind. Only a really phenomenal, off-the-chart, genius could have come up with them. - [Elmer] So Hardy writes back. The rigorous and strict mathematician he is, he asks for proof. (birds tweeting) Ramanujan, however, is nothing like Hardy. He works on intuition, often guided by dreams. - He would just see the result, or in some mystical versions of his own telling, he would say that his personal goddess, Namagiri, would come to him in his dreams, and write the formulas on his tongue. - Wait on his tongue? - On his tongue is the version I've sometimes heard. But in any case, she planted it in his mind. - [Elmer] \"An equation for me has no meaning unless it expresses a thought of God.\" Ramanujan never really learned how to provide proof to his theorems. So Hardy urges him to come to Cambridge to explain them in more detail. But there's a problem. (bird tweeting) Ramanujan is a devout Hindu. His faith forbids him from crossing the sea. Then one night his mother has a dream, (harp trilling) a goddess appears, and tells her to let Ramanujan fulfill his destiny. Convinced by the vision she gives her blessing. (camera clicking) And so, Ramanujan finally sets out for England. (inspiring music playing) In Cambridge, Hardy and Ramanujan start working together. - I mean, I'm gonna get choked up thinking about it. It's such a beautiful sentiment. Trying to remember how Hardy put it. It's something like he thought, (gentle music continuing) you know, on a scale from 0 to 100, you know, maybe he's a 10. Littlewood is a 30. Like Ramanujan is an 80, some kind of crazy thing like that. So he knew that Ramanujan was special. Hmm, didn't expect to get emotional for you, but this is what I do when I think about Ramanujan. (Professor Strogatz laughing) - [Elmer] But his new life in England is harsh. He's not used to the climate, (emotional string music) he's not used to the food, and war is ravaging. It will become one of the darkest chapters of his life. If you wanna know more about Ramanujan's struggles, and what made him such a genius, there's an upcoming video on our channel, Fern. - [Derek] While Ramanujan struggled, Hardy and he did make a breakthrough. (hopeful classical music playing) Around 1917, No text they invented what's known as the circle method, and used it to tackle different problems in number theory. Hardy and Littlewood later developed this idea further, and for the next a hundred years, this would be the main method to tackle the weak Goldbach conjecture. - But let's remind ourselves of the problem. We're trying to prove that we can always write an odd number, large odd number, as the sum of three primes. Call it P1, P2, and P3. (gentle inquisitive music) - But just like before, we don't only want to know whether it's possible, but in how many different ways it can be done. So, Hardy and Littlewood imagined a counting machine of sorts. As input, it would take all possible combinations of three prime numbers smaller than N. (machine ticking) For each combination it would add them up and check if that sum is equal to N. And, if it is, the machine increments a counter by 1. (bell dinging) But if not, the machine does nothing. (bell dinging) It goes on (machine whirring) to the next combination. (machine whirring) Let's do an example. (machine whirring) Say N is 11. Well, the machine first checks the primes 2, 2, and 2, adds them up to get 6, (machine whirring) which is not equal to 11. So the counter stays at 0. (bell dinging) Next it tries 2, 2, 3, which is 7. So again, it does nothing. (bell dinging) And it keeps cycling through until it hits 2, 2, 7, (bell dinging) which is equal to 11. (machine whirring) So now the machine increments the counter (bell dinging) by 1. As it keeps running through primes, the counter increments only one more time for 3, 3, 5. (bell dinging) (machine whirring) So in total, there are two ways to write 11 (bell dinging) as the sum of three primes. But how would you go about building this machine out of mathematics? (pen scratching) Because that is exactly what Hardy and Littlewood did. Their technique is so ingenious, I want to take you through it step by step. It starts with the function E to the I theta. This function just traces out a unit circle in the complex plane. The angle theta determines how far around the circle you are. Now imagine that theta is restricted to be some multiple M of 2 pi. And since 2 pi is one complete revolution, it doesn't matter if M is 0, 1, 2, 3, or any integer, a vector from the origin would always point in the same direction, to the right. But now Hardy and Littlewood multiply the angle by alpha, where alpha is just some number between 0 and 1. You can think of it as a slider. So if M equals 1, and you increase alpha from 0, well, the vector slowly makes one full rotation. If M equals 2, the vector will move around faster and make two full rotations. And this keeps going for higher values of M. Now imagine taking all possible values of alpha simultaneously, and then averaging out all of those vectors. Mathematically, we can write this as the integral from 0, to 1 of E of the I 2 pi alpha, D alpha. So what happens? Well, this vector cancels with this one on the opposite side, and this one with that one. And the same thing happens with all the vectors. So, averaging them, we get 0. The same thing happens if M equals 2, or 3, or 4. This integral will give 0 for all values of M. Except a single case. If M equals 0, then we have E to the 0 which equals 1. So no matter what alpha is, the vector always points to the right, and averaging that will always give 1. So this equation is very close to the machine we were trying to create. If M equals 0, it returns 1, (bell dinging) but if M is not equal to 0, it returns 0. (bell dinging) So all that's left to do is replace M with what we're interested in. Specifically, is the sum of P1 plus P2 plus P3 equal to N? We can rearrange that to get P1 plus P2 plus P3 minus equals 0. So, if we sub in this expression for M, then every time the three primes add up to N, this value will be 0, and the integral (bell dinging) will be equal to one. And every time the primes don't add up to N, this value will be non-zero. And so the integral will return 0. (bell dinging) But, right now, this equation only checks one triplet of primes. To check all possible combinations of primes smaller than N, we need to add a sum. Since this will count up all the ways three primes can add to make N, we can call it H of N. So in fact, let's try it out. Put in N equals 11, compute this function, and it gives 6. (wind whooshing) (paper rustling) Which is not the 2 we found before. So what happened? Well, we've simplified the logic a little bit, so we actually get some duplicates this time. For example, the machine finds 2, 2, 7, but also 7, 2, 2, and 2, 7, 2. Mathematicians correct for this when doing the real calculation, but for our purposes, this machine is good enough. So we've got our H of N, and if we can show that H of N is at least 1 for every odd number greater than 5, then we've proven the weak Goldbach conjecture. But there are two issues with this approach. The first is that we assumed that we know all of the prime numbers smaller than N, which is true when N is small. But as N goes to infinity, we just don't know all of the primes. The second problem is that, as the number of primes increases, the number of possible combinations explodes. If N is 10,001, there are 1,229 smaller prime numbers, which means a total of 310 million, 144 thousand, 296 possible prime triplets. Increase N to a billion, and the possible combinations jumps up to nearly 22 sextillion. (soft piano music playing) And this trend continues. So, using this approach in a simple way won't work. So Hardy and Littlewood came up with a smarter way. They fundamentally reframed the problem by taking the sum inside the integral. Rather than checking all possible combinations of prime numbers by brute force, they now analyze the collective behavior of all the primes at once. To see how this works, take a look at the equation. In the exponent is the sum of three primes minus N, but adding in the exponent is the same as multiplying exponentials together. So we can rewrite this as the product of four exponentials. The first three of these are actually identical because there's nothing to distinguish what we call P1, P2, P3. They're all prime numbers drawn from the same set. So we could just call this function S of alpha and N, and we could multiply it by itself three times, or just cube it. By doing this, H of N is now a function of just two things, E to the minus I two pi N alpha, which is just a complex number that you could compute, and this new function, S of alpha and N. But what is this function? Well, let's do an example. Again, say N equals 11. Then S of alpha and 11 equals just a sum of four exponentials, each governed by its own prime number. You can think of each of these exponentials as a clock, each with its own prime number that determines how fast the clock spins. So 2 turns the slowest, 3 turns faster, 5 turns faster still, and so on. But remember, this is a sum. So we actually need to add up all the clocks tip to tail. Now watch what happens as we increase alpha. All the clocks wind around at their own rates. What we're interested in is not the behavior of any individual clock, but instead all of them together. Since we've chosen a pretty small value for N, nothing too exciting happens, but watch what happens if we pick a larger value for N, like 99. Now there are 25 prime numbers that are smaller than 99, and hence 25 clocks in our sum. Now as we increase alpha, all the clocks, again, wind around at their different rates. It almost looks like a dragon's tail. And for a while everything seems kind of chaotic, circling around the origin, but then, when alpha hits 1 over 6, the tail unwinds, and suddenly almost all the clocks point in a similar direction, and we get a large resultant value. If we increase alpha further, the clocks cancel out again until we hit the next magic point, 1 over 3. Here again, many clocks line up. And this curious pattern keeps repeating. For the majority of values of alpha, the clocks cancel each other out. But at a few special points, like a half, the tail unwinds, the clocks interfere constructively, and we get a large resultant value. - If the angle is, you know, 360 degrees divided by a whole number, you get some very particular behavior that's very predictable. Those are the angles at which this function, when you sum the primes, they actually go far from from 0. And what happens at a random angle, and you just start adding the primes up, it keeps changing which way it's pointing, and the thing just bounces around. - So why is this happening? Well, let's look at when alpha equals a half. Here what we're doing is multiplying each prime number in the exponent by a half. In other words, dividing each prime number by 2. So let's do this for each of the primes. In the first column, we'll write down how many times it can be divided by 2. And in the second column we'll write down the remainder. So 2 divided by 2 equals 1, leaving a remainder of 0. So we've just made one full rotation. 3 divided by two is 1, but that leaves a remainder of 1, so it makes one full rotation and then a half rotation. 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1. So it makes two full rotations and then a half rotation more. Now, we don't really care about the first column because it doesn't matter how many full rotations a clock makes, we only care about where the arrow ends up. And that's fully determined by the remainder. It's just the remainder times alpha. So from now on we'll just keep track of the remainders. And what we find is that all of the other remainders are equal to 1. So all clocks, except the first one, point the same way. This is because when we're dividing whole numbers by 2, there are only two possible remainders, 0 or 1. And since we're working with prime numbers, only 2 can have the remainder 0, because no other prime number is even, therefore, all other primes must share the remainder 1. (wind whooshing) Meaning all those clocks end up making another half rotation, so they all point left and constructively interfere. (wind whooshing) A similar thing happens when alpha equals a third. Now each prime is divided by 3. So the possible remainders are 0, 1, or 2. Again, 3 is the only clock that has remainder 0, so that points right. But all the other primes follow a special pattern, a pattern that makes the entire circle method possible. The remaining primes distribute themselves roughly equally between remainders 1 and 2, which means all the remaining clocks are rotated one third or two thirds of the way around the circle. Since these clocks are pointing to the left, again, we get constructive interference. And this pattern of constructive interference also occurs for other small rational fractions. But for non-rational numbers, you don't get these nicely restricted remainders. So the clocks are roughly distributed equally all over the circle, and you get destructive interference. (upbeat tense music playing) Hardy and Littlewood realized they could use this. Imagine taking this plot of the magnitude of the resultant arrow and wrapping it around a circle. What they found is that the majority of the contributions come from very small regions of the circle, what they called the major arcs. The rest of the circle only adds minor contributions. So they called these the minor arcs. This allowed them to split up their calculation into two parts. The major arc part gives you the main term for how many ways you can write a number N as the sum of three primes. And the minor arcs just gives you an error term. (upbeat classical music playing) They then showed that, if the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, then the main term grows faster than the error term. So eventually, for some large enough number, call it K, this value will always be larger than 1, and the weak Goldbach conjecture holds. But there are two problems with this approach. No text The first is that they assumed that a generalization of the Riemann's hypothesis is true, which we don't know. And the second is that they didn't actually specify that number, K. I mean, how big of a number do you need to get to before you can guarantee that all numbers larger than that adhere to Goldbach conjecture? - Then we've got to wait until 1937 when Russian mathematician, Ivan Vinogradov, proves the same as Hardy and Littlewood. But he did it without the generalized Riemann hypothesis. So, you know, assumption free. - It's one thing to just assume the Riemann hypothesis, and say, \"Oh yeah, you can make some progress.\" But Vinogradov's like, \"No guys, you don't need the Riemann hypothesis. You can really prove this stuff.\" - But again, he gives some large enough number for which the weak Goldbach conjecture will hold without specifying that number. And so it's very unsatisfying. (bright classical music) Over the next 19 years, one of his students did get that satisfaction when he could specify that number. Do you want to have any guess as to what the number is? - 10 to the 50? 10 to the 80? 10 of the 3000? I don't know. I was guessing things that are far too low, probably. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's about 10 to the 6.8 million. - Wow, okay. - It's huge. But then you know, from here on, people start working on this method more, and they all use the same techniques. In 1989, the number was brought down to 10 to the 43,000. Next it dropped to 10 to the 7,194. And by 2002 it had dropped all the way down to 10 to the 1,346. Now that seems so much smaller than what we had before, but if you compare it to how many, you know, protons there are in the universe, which is 10 to the power 80, that's not something you can check by computer. It's absolutely, absolutely hopeless. Even if you turned the whole universe into a computer, you would still have no chance of solving this. So it really needed to get dragged down. - [Derek] This is roughly where the problem stood in 2005, when, Peruvian mathematician, Harald Helfgott became interested in it. (upbeat classical music playing) - He was reading papers about the weak Goldbach conjecture, and new techniques that were being developed. So these were the cutting edge techniques at the time. He was reading it and he thought. - I can do better. I'm having some ideas how to do better. And, you know, it took me a couple of weeks to get better estimates. Not still, you know, strong enough to revolutionize everything, but to make real progress. - So he gets to work and within a couple of weeks he's got better estimates than that in the paper. So now he's getting more confident, like, \"Okay, I got this.\" - Of course, I was a bit naive. I underestimate some difficulties elsewhere. (upbeat bright string music) - To solve the problem, he realized he needed to do two things. One, get the computational number as high as possible, and two, get the constant down as much as he could, which is where the difficult math comes in. So, over the next eight years, he attacked the problem from both sides. Together with David Platt, he checked all numbers up to 8.8 times 10 to the 30 by computer. And by refining his math, he slowly brought down the constant number, K. (numbers ticking) By 2013, he gets the number all the way down to 10 to the 27, which is below the number that his computers had already checked. - So he solved it. He wrote up his results in a paper called \"The Ternary Goldbach Conjecture is True,\" which is quite the mike-drop title. So, nearly 300 years after Goldbach's original letter, Helfgott proved that every odd number greater than five can be written as the sum of three primes. And as a result, he also proved that every even number greater than 2, can be written as the sum of at most four primes. This is because you can always just add 3 to all the odd numbers to get all the even numbers. - So was it a big deal? Were people excited? (playful gentle music playing) - Yeah, it's a good question. I feel like it is mostly an obscure problem. I think the strong one, and this with both of these problems, like they don't have any direct application to the real world. (inquisitive music continuing) Because it's so simple, it has this massive wide appeal, and everyone will kind of know about it. It's also one of the oldest unsolved problems. What did you do when you proved it? - Well, I put it on the archive. Like any normal person. It was a big relief. - You know, given your success (playful piano music playing) with the weak form of the Goldbach conjecture, how do you feel about the strong form? - Oh, I think that's hopeless for the moment. (Casper laughing) And if it yields. If it were to yield during our lifetimes, I wouldn't bet on it, in fact, I would bet against it. - See, the reason the circle method works for the weak Goldbach conjecture is because this main term grows faster than this error term. But that's not the case for the strong Goldbach conjecture. - The major arcs are no longer major. The main contribution comes from the minor arc. So at least as much of the contribution comes from the minor arcs. - So, to solve the strong conjecture, we need some fundamentally new technique, or approach, but we haven't found it yet. (tense classical music playing) - The person who arguably got the closest No text was Chen Jingrun. (pen scratching) In 1956, Chen was recognized for his mathematical prowess, and, a year later, he became an assistant at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he spent the next 10 years working on problems in number theory, including Goldbach's conjecture. By 1966, he hit a major breakthrough. By using another approach, known as sieve methods, he proved that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of a prime and a number that's either a prime, or the product of exactly two primes, what we call a semi prime. - It's a very learned and brilliant proof. I think Andre Weil compared following his proof, is like climbing along the top of the Himalayas. (wind whooshing) You know, that you're way up high in (laughing) practically the stratosphere. It's such a sophisticated argument. - This was the closest anyone had gotten to solving the problem. (playful music continuing) Elated, Chen showed the proof to a colleague, who suggested he should announce the result, and then tidy it up before publishing. - But just as Chen announced his result, the country plunged into chaos. (dramatic music) (crowd shouting) - [Derek] In May, 1966, chairman of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong, declared that bourgeois elements had infiltrated the government and society, and they must be purged. This marked the start of the Cultural Revolution, a radical campaign to defeat perceived enemies of the Party. With support from Mao, militant student revolutionaries, known as the Red Guard, (soldiers marching) stormed institutions. (soldiers marching) They burned books and turned on intellectuals. Teachers, scientists, and professors were subjected to brutal public spectacles, known as struggle sessions. They were beaten, humiliated, and forced to wear towering caps, and placards listing their supposed crimes, like capitalist sympathizer or enemy of the revolution. (emotional soft music) Across China, the pursuit of knowledge was replaced by fear and political conflict. By 1968, 131 of the 171 senior members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing faced persecution. And many others lost their lives. - Chen was one of the targets. (shove rattling) He was forced into manual labor, (fire crackling) and made to live in a converted boiler room with no electricity. (shove rattling) The Red Guard insulted him, spat on him, and beat him so badly that Chen often lost consciousness. - In one report, it was so bad that he may have tried to commit suicide. He jumped off of a third story building and, fortunately, didn't hit the ground. He landed on the second floor, and got injured, but didn't die. - [Derek] Despite all of this, (tense music playing) Chen kept secretly working on his math under the dim light of a kerosene lamp. Then on the 13th of September, (plane whirring) 1971, Mao's right-hand man died (camera clicking) in a mysterious plane crash. (camera clicking) After supposedly trying organize a coup. His death shattered the illusion of unity in the Party, (clicker clicking) and the cultural revolution began to lose steam. (clicker clicking) (bright dramatic music) - But Chen faced a dilemma. On the one hand, he wanted to publish his proof, but on the other he was terrified of being criticized, Unsure what to do, he turned to Luo Shengxiong, the head of the mathematical institute, who told him, \"The result is sound. You must publish.\" (dramatic music continuing) - [Derek] And so in April, 1973, Chen published his theorem. No text Three years later, Mao Zedong died and the Cultural Revolution ended. Famous journalist, Xu Chi took note of Chen's story, and wrote an article about his achievements and hardship. (uplifting music) The article was reprinted in China's most popular newspaper, and read by millions. The State that, just 10 years earlier, silenced Chen now celebrated him as a national hero. His story was retold in schools, books, and films. He even got an asteroid named after him in 1996. - And imagine if he hadn't done it, you know, if he hadn't published it. Like all his work, his whole mission, his whole ideals, his whole vision, maybe no one would've known about it. It would've just been a little line somewhere, like, \"Oh, I've got this proof, but, yeah, I'm not gonna show it to you.\" You know? But so often we like shoot ourselves down, whereas really do your best and then put it out into the world, and then let the world, sort of, like evaluate it. And while Chen got incredibly close, he was never able to fulfill his ultimate dream, to solve the strong Goldbach conjecture. (dramatic music playing) Perhaps one reason why it's so hard to prove true is because maybe it's not. Maybe it's false. No text But if it is false, then there's a very easy way to show that, by finding a counter example. A single even number that can't be written as the sum of two primes. - If Goldbach is false, it would be very easy for you to convince me that Goldbach is false. - Just find a counter example. - That is the only way that you can convince me that Goldbach is false. If Goldbach is false, then it's false because there's a counter example. And if there's a counter example, then you can give me the counter example, and I can check for myself, then, yes, that's a counter example. - [Casper] In this pursuit, in 1938, a mathematician, named Nils Pipping, checked all numbers up to a hundred thousand, by hand, but he didn't find a single counterexample. Since then, modern computers have brought this number up to four quintillion, and the conjecture holds for every single one of them. - [Derek] In fact, we can also use computers to check in just how many ways a different number can be written as the sum of two primes, (bright music) which gives us this pattern. It looks like a curve with tails, it strongly resembles a comet, which is why this is known as Goldbach's comet. It shows that as the number gets larger, there are more and more ways to write every even number as the sum of two primes. And if we overlay our heuristic argument from before, we find that it matches up remarkably well. - The one way the conjecture could be false is if, for whatever reason, at some very large number, there's a conspiracy where this completely breaks down, and it suddenly drops below that line. Are there any examples where you suddenly have a big drop in the number of ways you can compose a number? - No, no, those asymptotics seem to hold very nicely. There are no big drops. - [Derek] So it seems like the conjecture should be true. - We've tested, by brute force, all the numbers up to four quintillion, and they all obey Goldbach's conjecture. So you might think that we should have found a counterexample by now, or, at least, a number that doesn't follow this general trend we've seen. But, on the scale of all numbers, four quintillion is nothing. So we'll have to come up with some smart approach, or fundamentally new way, of solving this problem. Now, as far as we know, solving Goldbach's conjecture doesn't really affect any other areas of math. And it also doesn't seem to have any direct applications to the real world. So you might think, why bother solving this problem? Why not work on some big problem that we know is important? But I think that misses the point. (gentle inquisitive music) - What if the Goldbach conjectures turns out it is opening up a whole new part of the multiverse of mathematical ideas. We don't really know 'cause we don't have the bird's eye view, or the God's eye view, of math. It's what it looks like to us right now on the web of math. So, I tend to dislike this picture of certain things are central (inquisitive music continuing) and other things are peripheral. People should do what fires them up. Because if you do that, you'll be passionate, you'll think about it all the time. You'll do it when you're in the shower. You'll think about it when you're driving. And you might do something remarkable because of that passion. And if you're just doing something 'cause you think it's important, I think you'll tend to be second rate, honestly. (laughing) I like the modest view that we don't know what's necessarily important, but we do know what we love. So work on that. (electronics whirring) (inquisitive music continuing) - Goldbach's conjecture frustrated mathematicians for centuries. And, for a long time, (wind whooshing) it seemed like an unsolvable problem. Many gave up, thinking it was just too big to tackle. But as we've seen, it only takes a few incredibly determined individuals who reject the status quo to keep pushing towards a solution. And it's not just big math problems. Life is full of inconveniences (bright happy music) that some of us just start to accept as unsolvable. For me, shaving was one of these things. The irritation, the razor burn, the cost of constantly replacing razors. It felt like something I just kinda had to put up with. But then I started using (choir vocalizing) the Henson Razor, and I can honestly say it was a game changer. (upbeat joyful music) I've been using it ever since we first started working together two years ago, and now I don't go anywhere without it. And it's not just me.

I believed that every objecthas one single trajectory through space, one single path. But in this video, I will prove to youthat this is not the case. Everything is actually exploringall possible paths all at once. So let's start with a simple thoughtexperiment. Say you're at a beach when all of a sudden you see your friendsstruggling out in the water. You want to go help themas quickly as possible. So which pathshould you take to get there? The shortest path is a straight line,so you could head directly towards him. But you can run faster than you can swim,and this path requires more swimming. So alternatively,you could run down the beach to minimize thedistance through the water. But now the totaldistance is longer than it needs to be. So the optimal path,it turns out, is somewhere in between. To be precise, it depends on the speedsat which you can run and swim. Now, you might recognize thismathematical relationship because it is the exact same law that governs lightpassing from one medium into another. So light also takes the fastestpath from point A to point B. What's weird about this is that as humans, we can see where we want to goand then figure out the fastest route. But light, I mean, how does light know how to travelto minimize its journey time? Now here is wheremy misconception comes in. I shine a laser beam. The light just goes in one direction.I throw a ball. The ball just goes in one direction,you know? I would have answered,there is nothing strange about this. Light sets off from point Ain some direction. And then a little while laterit encounters a new medium. And due to local interactionswith that medium, it changes direction,ending up at point B. If you later find that of all the possiblepaths, light took the shortest time to get from A to B, I wouldn'tthink it was optimizing for anything. I would just think that's what happenswhen light obeys local rules. But now I will prove to you that lightdoesn't set out in only one direction. Instead, it really does explore all possible paths. And the same is true for electronsand protons. All quantum particles. So the fact that we see things on single,well-defined trajectories is, in a way, the most convincing illusionnature has ever devised. And the way it works all comes down to aquantity known as the action. In a previous video, we showedhow an obscure scientist, Maupertuis, made an ad hoc proposalthat there should be a quantity called action, which he definedas mass times velocity times distance. And he claimed that everythingalways follows the path that minimizes the action. Hamilton later showed that this actionis equivalent to the integral over time of kinetic energyminus potential energy. Action was useful and an alternative wayof solving physics problems, especially when Newton's lawsget too cumbersome. But then, around the turn of the 20thcentury, action showed up at the heart of a scientific revolution:the birth of quantum mechanics. It all started with electriclighting in Germany. Think about what it's like in the 1890s,right? Electricity being more widely available,at least in urban sectors. And things like, you know, light bulbs. They were new. They were literally the hot new thing. Germany wanted to replace all their gasstreet lights with electric light bulbs. So an important question washow do you maximize the visible lightgiven off by a hot filament? Scientists at a German researchinstitute, the PTR, studied how much light different materialsemitted as a function of temperature. At low temperatures, each materialgave off its own characteristic spectrum, mostly in the infrared,but above about 500\u00b0C all materials started to glowin the same way, with an almost identicaldistribution of light. The hotter the object,the more energy was emitted at every wavelength, and the peakof the distribution shifted to the left. But they still didn't understandhow it worked theoretically. So that was sort of the next step, right? If you can understand how it workstheoretically, then you can use that theoryto potentially design your products. They started by imaginingthe simplest object possible, one that would absorb all lightthat falls onto it and perfectly emit radiationbased on its temperature. They came up with a hole in a metal cube. This hole is a perfect blackbodybecause any light that shines onto it will go straight in, bouncearound inside, and eventually be absorbed. But this also makes it a perfect emitter. Any radiation inside the cube can escapethrough the hole unimpeded. Theorists reasoned that electronsin the walls of the cube would wiggle around,emitting electromagnetic waves. These waveswould then bounce off the other walls. When you have two wavesof the same frequency, where one travels to the rightand the other to the left, they can interfere in such a way that they create placeswhere there's no wave amplitude those are nodes, and places where there ismaximum wave amplitude, the anti nodes. Waves like this are calledstanding waves because they don't really move leftor right and inside a cavity,given enough time and reflections. It is only these standing wavesthat survive. All the other ones just cancel out. So a sort of order emerges from the chaos. In two dimensions, standing waveslook something like this. For shorter wavelengthsor higher frequencies, you can fit more and more different vibrational modes. Inside this cube, so that in threedimensions, the total number of modes is proportional to frequency cubed,or one over lambda cubed. The expectation wasthere would be more and more waves inside the cube,the shorter the wavelength. This led directly to the Rayleigh-Jeans law.At longer wavelengths. It matched the experimental datapretty well, but at shorter wavelengthsthe theory diverged from experiment. In fact, it predictedthat at the shortest wavelengths, an infinite amount of energywould be emitted. This, for obvious reasons, became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe. The person to solvethis problem was Max Planck, but Planck almost didn'tmake it into studying physics, because when he was 16 years old,he went up to his professor and asked him, well,maybe I could do a career in physics. To which his professor respondedthat he'd better find another field to do research in, because physicswas essentially a complete science. You know, there was just a few tinylittle problems that they had to clean up. But besides that, it was over. But Planck didn't listen. By 1897, he was a professor himself,and for the next three years he struggled to find a theoretical explanationfor blackbody radiation. He tried approach after approach,but no matter what, he tried. Nothing worked. He said I was ready to sacrificeevery one of my previous convictions about physical laws. Then, in a quote \u2018act of desperation\u2019, he did somethingno one had thought to try. According to classical physics,the energy of an electromagnetic wave depends only on its amplitude,not its wavelength or frequency. And it could take any arbitrary value. So any atom could emitany wavelength of light with an arbitrarilysmall amount of energy. But Planck tried restricting the energy so that it could only come in multiplesof a smallest amount. A quantum. And he made the energy of one quantumdirectly proportional to its frequency. E equals hf, where h is just a constant. Think about what this does to the radiation coming from the blackbodyat a given temperature. The atoms in the cavityhave a range of energies. Some have a little bit. A few have a lot, and most of their energysomewhere in between. For long wavelengthlow frequency radiation, the energy HF of one quantum is small,so all of the atoms have enough energy to emit this wavelength, and the spectrum matchesthe really gene's prediction very well. But at shorterwavelengths, higher frequencies, the energy of a quantum increases. And now not all of the atoms haveenough energy to emit that wavelength. This is why experiment divergesfrom the classical prediction. The spectrum peaksand then starts to fall because fewer and fewer atoms have enough energyto emit one quantum of that radiation. And there comes a point when none of the atoms have enough energyto emit one quantum. So here the spectrum must drop to zero. With this approach, Planck got a new formulafor the radiation spectrum. Now all that was left for him to dowas to tune the parameter h. And when he did this just right,he got his formula to match up perfectly with experiment. But he was sort of troubled by his own formula because to himit was just a mathematical trick. He had no clue why it worked. It was purely formal. And most importantly,he had no clue what this H represented. I mean, he had introduced a newphysical constant without any reason. He wrote a theoretical interpretation had to be found at any cost,no matter how high. So from that momenton, he dedicated himself to finding one. He later reflected that after some weeksof the most strenuous work of my life, light came into the darknessand a new undreamed of perspective opened up before me. He introduceswhat we now call Planck's constant, and it has the units of action. Planck'sconstant, h is a quantum of action. Planck later proposed that any timeany change happened in nature, it would be some whole multipleof this quantum of action. So it's kind of spooky, this breakthroughthat starts the ball rolling toward quantum theory brings action in not energy and not force. Action. Gives you a hint. At first, the quantum of actiongot little attention. That is, until a 26 year old patent clerk came on the scene. In 1905, Albert Einstein claimed that Planck's theorywasn't just a mathematical trick. It was telling usthat light actually comes in discrete packets,or photons, each with an energy HF. Einstein used this insightto explain the photoelectric effect how light can eject electrons from metal,but only when the frequency is high enough. If the frequency is too low, no electrons will be emittedregardless of the intensity. The idea of quantization spread. Eight years later,Niels Bohr was trying to understand how an atom is stableif it has a positive charge in the center and negative electrons whizzing around it. Why don't they just spiralinto the nucleus, radiating their energy as they go? And what he wants to do is,he says there's something fishy about something being discretethat seems to be the new ambiguous weirdo lesson of the new quantum of action. Bohrrealizes that as the electron goes around the nucleus,it has an angular momentum. Mass times velocity times radius. So angular momentumhas the same units as action. And so what he decides to do is discretizethe orbital angular momentum. For no good reason he says, let me slap that on and say,and imagine the electron can only be in one unit, two units,three units of the same quantity H. And because it's talking about motionin a circle, the factors two pi come in. So is really nh over two pi,what we now call an h bar. This comes out of nowhere. There seems likeabsolutely no good reason why angular momentum should be quantized. But by doing it, Bohr finds the correctenergy levels of the hydrogen atom. When an electron jumps from a higher orbitto a lower one, the energy difference is given off as a photonof a particular color of light. Exactly reproducing the hydrogen spectrum. And that was a pretty startling thingto have fall out. I think that really was compelling. Take some quantity with the unit of actionand apply some, again, kind of ad hoc, discretization or quantization to it. Now, although it workedspectacularly well, no one can make sense of it. That is until 11 years later. For his PhD, Louis de Broglie was contemplatingthe recent discoveries in physics. And his big insight was that if lightcould be both a wave and a particle, then maybe matter particles could also be waves. He proposed that everything. Electrons, basketballs, people,absolutely everything has a wavelength. And he defined this wavelengthanalogously to light as Planck's constant,divided by the particles momentum or mass times velocity. Now, if an electron is a wave,the only way it could stay bound to a nucleus in an atom isif it exists as a standing wave. That requiresthat a whole number of wavelengths fit around the circumference of the orbit. You could have one wavelengthor two wavelengths or three, and so on. So the circumference two pir must be equal to some multiple n times the wavelength. We can sub in de Broglies expressionfor the wavelength to get the two pi r equals NH over mv, but we can rearrange this to get the mvr. The angular momentumis equal to NH over two pi. That is precisely Bohr's quantizedangular momentum condition. But now we have a good physical reasonwhy it's quantized. Because electrons are waves and they must exist as standingwaves to be bound in atoms because they want to have constructiveinterference, have a stable orbit back. That's pretty good. You get a dissertation out of that.That's pretty good. It is this wave nature of quantum objects. That means they no longerhave a single path through space. Instead,they must explore all possible paths. Now, I have thought aboutand taught the double slit experiment hundreds of timeswithout fully realizing this implication. In the double slit experiment. I feel like the mental thingthat I'm doing in my head is like, okay, well, the beam is not perfectly straight,and of course it's going to intersect both of those slits because they're reallyclose together. You know? But thenI heard this story about a professor teaching the double slit experiment,and it makes everything so clear. So the professor starts by explainingthe setup. Electrons are fired one at a time through two slitsto be detected at a screen. Now, because you can't say for certainwhich slit the particle went through, quantum mechanics tells usit must go through both at the same time. So to get the probability of findinga particle somewhere on the screen, you simply add up the amplitude of the wavegoing through one slit, with the amplitude of the wave going through the other slitand square it. But that's when a student raised his hand. What if you add a third slit? Well, you just add up the amplitudesof the waves going through each of the three slits,and you can work out the probability. The professor wanted to continue,but then the student interjected again. What if you add a fourth slit and a fifth? The professor, who is now clearly losinghis patience, replies, I think it's clear to the whole class that you just add upthe amplitudes from all the slits. It's the same for six, seven, etc. but now the bold studentpressed his advantage. What if I make it infinite slits so that the screen disappears? And then I add a second screenwith infinite slits and a third and a fourth. The student's point was clear. Even when we're not doinga double slit experiment, when it's just light or particlestraveling through empty space, they must be exploring all possible paths. Because this is exactly how the math would work if you had infinite screens,each with infinite slits. You have to add up the amplitudefrom each slit. That's just the way it works. According to the story, the student was Richard Feynman,and while the story is made up, the logic is flawless. Because if you believein the double slit experiment that you can't tell which of the two slitsthe particle went through, then you have to consider the possibilitythat it goes through both. By that same logic, any time any particle goes from placeone to place two. You have to considerall the possible paths it could take to get there, including onesthat go faster than the speed of light, including ones that go back in time, and including ones that goto the other side of the moon and back. I feel like I can't go to the sunand back. You have to restrict itto be local, right? So the math doesn't do that. I mean, you could see thatjust in the double slit experiment, right? And we'll do light because then there'sno funky business with the speed. If you're going to say like,this path interferes with this path and these distancesare different, right. And so clearlythey can\u2019t have the same speed. So you need to considerpaths that have different speeds. Feynman's way of doing quantum mechanics suggests that anything going from one place to another is connectedin every possible way. And the internet is kind of like that too connecting us to anything,anywhere, at any time. At least in theory,there are still artificial barriers like geo blocks and country restrictionsthat block off parts of the internet. But fortunately, there's today's sponsor,NordVPN, which can help knock down those barriers. Just connect to one of their thousands ofservers, for example, this one in the US.

So according to Feynman,any time a particle, a photon, or even a macroscopic object moves from point 1 to point 2, it has some chance to take any path. And as preposterous as it might sound. He found that we need to includeall these paths in our calculation, where each path is weighted the same. So why then, do we not see all those crazy paths? Well, that's because we still needto add up their amplitudes. For simplicity,imagine we only have three paths. Then here's what we're going to do. First, let's take this one. When the particle wave startsfollowing it, we start a stopwatch. It goes around and around very fast,and when it gets to the end point, we hit stop. We'll do the same for the other two paths.And then we add up the arrows, square the result. And that isthen proportional to the probability the particle took those pathsto get there. In this casethe arrow and square are pretty small, so the probability of the particle going from1 to 2 using these paths is small. Compare that with these three paths. For example. Well now the arrow is much larger. And this is important. The larger the resulting arrow, the higherthe probability of that event happening. Now in these examples the stopwatch is notactually measuring time. Instead it measuressomething called the phase. Just as in the double slit experiment,when a wave takes a different path from point 1 to 2, it will end up therewith a different phase. And this phase is what determines the amplitude of the wave at that point. Mathematically, we can write the amplitudeour stopwatch as e to the I phi, where phi is the phase. As the particle wave follows a path,its phase increases. Winding the vector around. So now the big question is how much does the phase change for each path? Well, to answer that, imaginewe split up the path into many tiny sections, each oneso small that it's effectively straight. Then in each section, the particle wave goesa distance delta x and a time delta t, and the increase in phaseis easy to compute. It just depends on the wavelengthand frequency of the wave. To find the total increase in phasefor the whole path, we just add up all the little phaseincreases of all the individual sections. But we can sub in lambda equalsh over mv from de Broglie, and using e we can sub in for frequency. We can also simplify by writing h over twopi as h bar. To get this expression. Then we can take delta t to the right. And if we make deltat infinitesimally small, then we can replace thissum with an integral. But now Dx by Dt is just velocity. So we can write this as m b squared. Now we know that in the simplest casethe total energy e is just kinetic plus potential energy. And subbing that in we're leftwith the integral over time of kinetic energyminus potential energy. But wait a second. That is just the classical action. So it's action that determines how fast the stopwatch turns. As the particle moves along a trajectory, its action increases,and that is what increases the phase. And what's important to note is that hbar is tiny. It's about ten to the -34 joule seconds,which is way smaller than the actionof any everyday object. That means the phase of ordinary objectson ordinary paths spins around zillions of times,eventually pointing in some random direction. If you consider a slightly different path, the action may be slightly differentsay 0.01 joule seconds different. That doesn't seem like much,but divide it by h bar and the arrow will spin aroundten to the 32 more times. So again, it will just pointin some random direction. This is what happensto almost all of the possible paths. So when you add up the phases,they just cancel out. They destructively interfere. The only exception is for the pathsclosest to the path of least action,because these paths are at a minimum. So if you make tiny changes to the pathto first order, the action doesn't change. And so for other paths that are very closeto the path of least action, their arrows pointin basically the same direction. They constructively interfere. And that is why those are the pathswe see. This explains how light knows where to go. I mean, it doesn't. It just explores all possible paths, but the past we end up seeing are the onesthat interfere constructively. And those are the paths of least action. So really, this is how classical mechanics emergesfrom quantum mechanics. It's why a ball follows the trajectoryit does, and how planets orbit the sun. They don't really have a precisetrajectory. Instead, everything exploresall possible paths. It's just that massive particleshave large actions compared to hbar, so that only paths extremely closeto the true path of least action survive. Which is why they're much more particlelike. If you go to much smaller particleslike electrons or photons, the actions are much smaller,and so there's more of a spread in which trajectoriesthey actually end up taking. Now, you might say,I still don't believe you, but Casper has this incredible demo that should convince you 100%that this is really how the world works. To do it, I've taken a light,a mirror and a camera. Now there are infinitely many pathsthat the light could take. And according to Feynman,we have to add the contributions of each them. Including paths that go like this. Now, you might say he's crazy. I'm not crazy. That's what happens. Another possibility is I could come here and go. Or it could come here and go. Or it could comewhere you'd like it to come and go. And it can go over here and go and so on and so on. And these are all possibilities. And every single one of these pathshas their own little arrow. So what we can do is we can look at allthose arrows and see where they line up. And so if I turn on this light,that's exactly where you see it reflects that at the angle of incidenceis equal to the angle of reflection. But now what I'm going to dois I'm going to cover up that spot so that we no longersee the light reflect. And then I'm going to provethat really Feynman is right. That really lightalso goes like this. It's just that most of the time,those effects are cancelled out. Now that sounds impossible, right? But let's zoom in to this tiny pieceright here. Then we see all these different pathsand all the arrows just go around and around in circles. So when you add them up,they all just cancel out. But what if I cover up about half of themlike so. Well, now when I add up those arrows yousuddenly do see a large resulting arrow. And so if I can somehow cover upthis mirror in many, many tiny strips, then I should be able to get the lightto reflect like this. And I can do that with this piece of foilright here on this piece of foil. There are about a thousand linesper millimeter, and that should be enough to get this effect. So let me turn off the lights. So let's seeI'm going to turn it on in 321. We see it. That is so cool. It actually looks a lot weirderthan I was expecting it to. I was expecting more like, one spot, but there's many, many spotswhere it's reflecting. Oh, okay. Okay. And just to show,I haven't been cheating you, right underneath is my finger. And even with the lighton, you know, we see the light reflect. And if we remove the cover, then what do we see? Yeah, we see exactly the normal reflection where it's always supposed to go,which is right there. And then we've gotnow all these extra reflections, all these extra bitswhere the pattern just lines up. So very, very cool. When I was talking about thiswith a friend, actually, he said, yeah,but you're using a diffraction grating. That's kind of like cheating. You get all these other reflectionsright now and this light is justgoing in all directions. And so there's one other thing. I've been super, super curious to try. I also want to do this with a laserwhere I shine the laser right next to it. And then if light does take every possiblepath, we should also see it come off here. It probably shouldn't work. I actually have a laser right over here and we can see when I shine it. It really does. Just go to one spotand you can see where that spot is. It's right over there, which is about thesame place where we had our reflection. And you can also see right now if we look at this view that you cannot seethe laser light at all. Right. Like I could see the laser, but I have tobring it out all the way over here. And then I'm able to sort ofsee the light. But if I just put it up here,you can see the reflection. Now, what I'm going to do nextis I'm going to put this foil, this magic foil, and I'm going to put it over hereand we can turn off this. And now let's see what happenswhen I turn on the laser. Wait wait wait wait. No way, no way. It works. It works. Wait. What? Look where the laser is going. Oh, my God, it actually works. What? What? This is definitely the coolest demoI've ever done. So what I was doing is I was holdingthe laser, and I can show you right now. I was shining it down, like, this way off. And you could still see it reflect. But if I take this away, it disappears. And if I put this back, it appears so that it shows really that we cannot get rid of the area which gives zerothat it really is canceling out. And if we do clever things to it, we can demonstrate the reality of thereflections from this part of the mirror. So light and by extension, everything really doesexplore all possible paths. It's just that most of the timethe crazy paths destructively interfere. That's because the actions of nearby pathschange rapidly. Now, I've studied physics for most of my life,and I feel like I never really appreciated how important actionand the principle of least action are. But now I think I finally get it. And I finally get why. If you ask theoretical physicistswhat they're working on, they'll rarely talk about energyor forces. Most of the time,they'll talk about action. Nobody in particle physics approachesparticle physics from a viewpoint other than least action. But we teach physics historically,and no least action is almost like the new kid on the blockfor understanding physics. And so, yeah, we build up to it. But in reality, I think life's a lot easier onceyou realize this underlying principle, because when you do,then all you have to do is write down the correct Lagrangianso you get the right action and out come the laws of physics. So you've got a separate Lagrangianfor classical mechanics, for special relativity,for electrodynamics, and so on. It's a single mathematical frameworkthat, once you've learned it, then you can apply it in different placesin exactly the same way. The huntfor the theory of everything, right. The thing that will encompassall of physics in reality, what people are asking iswhat is this Lagrangian that can spit out all of the lawsof physics in this universe? That's really what they're asking. The momentwe haven't really found that right. Because we canwe can sticky tape things together, but we don't know if that's the propermathematical structure. So that's what people are hunting for. This was our secondvideo on the principle of least action. And I know we've covered a lot,but you might still have some questions.

A solution so tiny it would be invisible. I'm inclined to believe this is possible, thanks to a recentbreakthrough that solved one of the biggest problemsof the last century. How to determine thestructure of a protein? It's been described to me as equivalent to Fermat's last theorem, but for biology. Over six decades, tens of thousands of biologists painstakingly worked out the structure of 150,000 proteins. Then in just a few years, a team of around 15 determined thestructure of 200 million. That's basically every proteinknown to exist in nature. So how did they do it and why does this have the potential to solve problems wayoutside the realm of biology? A protein starts simply asa string of amino acids. Each amino acid has acarbon atom at the center. Then on one side is an amine group, and on the other side is a carboxyl group. And the last thing it'sbonded to could be one of 20 different side chains, and which one determines which of the 20 different aminoacids this molecule is. The amine group fromone amino acid can react with the carboxyl group ofanother to form a peptide bond. So a series of amino acidscan bond to form a string and pushing and pulling between countless molecules,electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, solvent interactions can cause this string tocoil up and fold onto itself. This ultimately determines the3D structure of the protein. And this shape is the thing that really matters about the protein. It's built for a specific purpose, like how hemoglobin hasthe perfect binding site to carry around oxygen in your blood. These are machines, they need to be in their correct orientationin order to work together to move, for example, theproteins in your muscles. They change their shape a little bit in order to pull and contract. But it would take people a long time to get the structure of just one protein. Absolutely. So what should proteins look like? Was only started to answer really with experimental techniques. [Derek] The first way proteinstructure was determined was by creating a crystalout of that protein. This was then exposed to x-rays to get a diffraction pattern, and then scientists would work backwards to try to figure out what shape of molecules would create such a pattern. It took British biochemist,John Kendrew, 12 years to get the first protein structure. His target was an oxygen storingprotein called myoglobin, an important protein in our hearts. He first tried a horse heart, but this produced rather small crystals because it didn't have enough myoglobin. He knew diving mammals would have lots of myoglobin in their muscles since they're the bestat conserving oxygen. So he obtained a huge chunkof whale meat from Peru. This finally gave Kendrewlarge enough crystals to create an x-ray diffraction image. And when it came out,it looked really weird. People expected something kind of logical,mathematical, understandable, and it almost looked, Iwouldn't say ugly, but intricate and complex and kind of like if you see a rocket motor, and all the parts hanging off. [Derek] This structure,which has been called \"Turd of the century,\" won Kendrew, the 1962Nobel Prize in chemistry. Over the next two decades, only around a hundred morestructures were resolved. Even today, protein crystallizationremains a big challenge. Frankly it is not uncommon that just a couple protein structures can be someone's entire PhD. Sometimes just one, sometimeseven just progress toward one, And it's expensive. X-ray crystallographycan cost 10s of thousands of dollars per protein. So scientists sought another way to work out protein structure. It only costs around a hundred dollars to find a protein sequence of amino acids. So if you could use this to figure out how the protein would fold, that would save a lot oftime, effort, and money. I kind of know how carbon behaves and I know how carbon sticks to a sulfur and how that might sticknext to a nitrogen. And if these ones are here, then I can imagine this onefolding, making that bond there. So it seems like if you have some sense of basic molecular dynamics,you might be able to figure out how this protein's gonna fold. One of the few truepredictions in biology was actually Linus Paulinglooking at just the geometry of the building blocks of proteins and saying, actually theyshould make helices and sheets. That's what we call secondary structure, the very local kind of twistsand turns of the protein. But beyond helices and sheets, biochemists could not figureout any reliable patterns that would lead to the finalstructure of all proteins. One reason for this is thatevolution didn't design proteins from the ground up. It's kind of like a programmer that doesn't know what they're doing, and whenever it looked good, they just kept adding that kind of thing. And that's how you end up with these both amazing objects and incredibly complexand hard to describe. They don't have purposeunderneath them in the same way as like a human designed machine would. [Derek] To illustrate justhow complicated this process can get, MIT biologist Cyrus Levinthal did a back-of-the-envelope calculation, and he showed that evena short protein chain with 35 amino acids can fold in an astronomical number of ways. So even if a computer checkedthe energy instability of 30,000 configurations every nanosecond, it would take 200 timesthe age of the universe to find the correct structure. Refusing to give up, the University of Marylandprofessor John Moult started a competition called CASP in 1994. The challenge was simple,to design a computer model that could take an amino acid sequence and output its structure. The modelers would notknow the correct structure beforehand, but the output fromeach model would be compared to the experimentallydetermined structure. A perfect match wouldget a score of a hundred, but anything over 90 wasconsidered close enough that the structure was solved. CASP competitors gatheredat an old wooden chapel turned conference centerin Monterey, California, and at any point where aprediction didn't make sense, they were encouraged to taptheir feet as friendly banter. There was a lot of foot tapping. (foot tapping) In the first year, teamscould not achieve scores higher than 40. The early front runner wasan algorithm called Rosetta, created by University ofWashington biologist David Baker. One of his innovationswas to boost computation by pooling together processingpower from idle computers in homes, schools, andlibraries that volunteered to install his softwarecalled Rosetta at Home. As part of it, there was a screensaver that showed basically the course of the protein folding calculation. And then we started gettingpeople writing in saying that they were watching the screensaver and they thought they coulddo better than the computer. So Baker had an idea. He created a video game. (upbeat music) The game called Fold It, set up a protein chain capable of twisting and turning into different arrangements. But now instead of thecomputer making the moves, the game players, thehumans could make the moves. Within three weeks, more than 50,000 gamers pooled their efforts to decipher an enzyme that plays a key role in HIV. X-Ray crystallography showedtheir result was correct. The gamers even got credited as co-authors on the research paper. Now, one man who played Fold It was a former child chessprodigy named Demis Hassabis. Hassabis had recently startedan AI company called DeepMind. Their AI algorithm, AlphaGo made headlines for beating world championLee Sedol at the game of Go. One of AlphaGo's moves, move37, shook Sedol to his core. But Hassabis never forgot abouthis time as a Fold It gamer. So of course I was fascinated this just from games design perspective. You know, wouldn't it beamazing if we could mimic the intuition of these gamerswho were only, by the way, of course, amateur biologists. After returning from Korea, DeepMind researchers hada week-long hackathon where they tried totrain AI to play Fold It. This was the beginning ofHassabis' longstanding goal of using AI to advance science. He initiated a newproject called Alpha Fold to solve the protein folding problem. Meanwhile at CASP, the quality of prediction from the best performers, including Rosetta had plateaued. In fact, the performance wentdownhill after CASP eight. The predictions weren't good enough, even with faster computers and a growing number of structures in the protein data bank to train on. DeepMind hoped to changethis with AlphaFold. Its first iteration, AlphaFold 1, was a standard off-the-shelfdeep neural network like the ones used for computervision at that time. The researchers trained it on lots and lots of protein structuresfrom the protein data bank. As input, AlphaFold took theprotein's amino acid sequence and an important set ofclues given by evolution. Evolution is driven by mutations, changes in the genetic code, which in turn change the amino acids within a given protein sequence. But as species evolve, proteinsneed to retain the shape that allows them to performtheir specific function. For instance, hemoglobin looksthe same in humans, cats, horses, and basically any mammal. Evolution says, if itain't broke, don't fix it. So we can compare sequences of the same proteinacross different species in this evolutionary table. Where sequences are similar, it's likely they are important in the protein structure and function. But even where thesequences are different, it's helpful to look at wheremutations happen in pairs because they can identifywhich amino acids are close to each otherin the final structure. Say two amino acids, apositively charged lysine and a negatively chargedglutamic acid attract and hold each other in the folded protein. Now, if a mutation changes lysine to a negatively charged amino acid, it would repel glutamic acid and destabilize the whole protein. Therefore, another mutationmust replace glutamic acid with a positively charged amino acid. This is known as co-evolution. These evolutionary tables were an important input for AlphaFold. As output, instead of directlyproducing a 3D structure, AlphaFold predicted a simpler2D pair representation of that structure. The amino acid sequence is laid out horizontally and vertically. Whenever two amino acids are close to each other in the final structure, their corresponding rowcolumn intersection is bright. Distant amino acid pairs are dim. In addition to distances, the pair representationcan also hold information on how amino acid molecules are twisted within the structure. AlphaFold 1 fed the protein sequence and its evolutionary tableinto its deep neural network, which it had trained to predictthe pair representation. Once it had this, aseparate algorithm folded the amino acid string based on the distance and torsion constraints. And this was the finalprotein structure prediction. With this framework,AlphaFold entered CASP 13 and it immediately turned heads. It was the clear winnerafter many additions, but it wasn't perfect. Its score of 70 was not enough to clear the CASP threshold of 90. DeepMind needed to getback to the drawing board to get better results. So Hassabis recruited JohnJumper to lead AlphaFold. AlphaFold 2 was reallya system about designing our deep learning. The individual blocks to begood at learning about proteins, have the types of geometricphysical, evolutionary concepts that were needed and put itinto the middle of the network instead of a process around it. And that was a tremendous accuracy boost. [Derek] There were three key stepsto get better results with AI. First, maximum compute power. Here, DeepMind wasalready better positioned than anybody in the world. It had access to the enormouscomputing power of Google, including their tensor processing units. Second, they needed alarge and diverse data set. Is data the biggest roadblock and why? I think it's too easy tosay data's the roadblock and we should be careful about it. AlphaFold 2 was trained onthe exact same data with much, much better machinelearning as AlphaFold 1. So everyone overestimatesthe data blockage because it gets less severewith better machine learning. [Derek] And that was the third keyelement, better AI algorithms. Now AI is not just goodat protein folding. It can do all kinds of tasks that no one likes from writing emails to answering phone calls. Something I hate is buildingand maintaining a website.

As the AlphaFold 2 teamsearched for better algorithms, they turned to the transformer. That's the T in ChatGPT. And it relies on aconcept called attention. In the sentence, the animal didn't cross thestreet because it was too tired. Attention recognizesthat it refers to animal and not street based on the word tired. Attention adds context to anykind of sequential information by breaking it down into chunks, converting these intonumerical representations or embeddings and makingconnections between them. In this case, the word it and animal. 3Blue1Brown has a great series of videos specifically abouttransformers and attention. Large language models use attention to predict the most appropriateword to add to a sentence, but AlphaFold also hassequential information, not sentences, but amino acid sequences. And to analyze them, the AlphaFold team built their own version of the transformer called an EVO Former. The EVO Former contained two towers, evolutionary informationin the biology tower and pair representationsin the geometry tower. Gone was AlphaFold 1's deepneural network that started with one tower and predicted the other. Instead, AlphaFold 2's EVO Former builds each tower separately. It starts with some initial guesses, evolutionary tables taken fromknown data sets as before, and the pair representations based on similar known proteins. And this time there's a bridgeconnecting the two towers that conveys newly foundbiological and geometry clues back and forth. In the biology tower, attention applied on a column identifies amino acid sequencesthat have been conserved. While along a row, itfinds amino acid mutations that have occurred together. Whenever the EVO Former findstoo closely linked amino acids in the evolutionary table. It means they are important to structure and it sends this informationto the geometry tower. Here attention is applied to help calculate distancesbetween amino acids. There's also this thingcalled triangular attention that got introduced, which is essentially about letting triplets attend to each other. [Derek] For each triplet of amino acids, AlphaFold applies the triangle inequality. The sum of two sides mustbe greater than the third. This constrains how far apart these three amino acids can be. This information is used toupdate the pair representation, And that helps the model produce like a self-consistentpicture of the structure. [Derek] If the geometrytower finds it's impossible for two amino acids tobe close to each other, then it tells the first tower to ignore their relationshipin the evolutionary table. This exchange of informationwithin the EVO Former goes on for 48 times, until information withinboth towers is refined. The geometrical featureslearned by this network are passed onto AlphaFold2's second main innovation, the structure module. For each amino acid, we pick three specialatoms in the amino acid and say that those define a frame. And what the network does is it imagines that all the amino acidsstart out with the origin and it has to predict theappropriate translation and rotation to move these frames to where they sit in the real structure. So that's essentially whatthe structure module does. But the thing that setsthe structure module apart is what it doesn't do. Previously, people mighthave imagined that you would like to encode the fact thatthis is a chain, you know, and that certain residueshould sit next to each other. We don't really explicitlytell AlphaFold that. It's more like we giveit a bag of amino acids and it's allowed to positioneach of them separately. And some people havethought that that helps it to not get stuck in terms ofwhere things should be placed. It doesn't have to always bethinking about the constraint of these things forming a chain, that's something thatemerges naturally later. [Derek] That's why liveAlphaFold folding videos can show it doing someweirdly non-physical stuff. The structure module outputs a 3D protein, but it still isn't ready. It's recycled at least three more times through the Evo Former togain a deeper understanding of the protein only then thefinal prediction is made. In December, 2020, DeepMindreturned to a virtual CASP with AlphaFold 2, andthis time they did it. I'm going to read anemail from John Moult. \"Your group has performedamazingly well in CASP 14, both relative to other groups and in absolute model accuracy. Congratulations on this work.\" [Derek] For many proteins,AlphaFold 2 predictions were virtually indistinguishablefrom the actual structures and they finally beat thegold standard score of 90. For me, having workedon this problem so long, after many, many stops and starts, and suddenly this is a solution. We'd solved the problem. This gives you such excitementabout the way science works. [Derek] Over six decades,all of the scientists working around the world onproteins painstakingly found about 150,000 protein structures. Then in one fell swoop, AlphaFold came in and unveiled over 200 million of them. Nearly all proteinsknown to exist in nature. In just a few months,AlphaFold advanced the work of research labs worldwideby several decades. It has directly helped usdevelop a vaccine for malaria. It's made possible the breaking down of antibiotic resistance enzymes, which make many life-savingdrugs effective again. It's even helped us understand how protein mutations lead to various diseases fromschizophrenia to cancer, and biologists studying little known and endangered species suddenly had access to proteinsand their life mechanism. The AlphaFold 2 paper hasbeen cited over 30,000 times. It has truly made a step function leap in our understanding of life. John Jumper and DemisHassabis were awarded one half of the 2024 Nobel Prize inchemistry for this breakthrough. The other half went to David Baker, but not for predictingstructures using Rosetta. Instead, it was for designing completely new proteins from scratch. It was really hard tomake brand new proteins that would do things. And so that's kind of theproblem that we solved. To do so, he uses thesame kind of generative AI that makes art in programs like Dall-E. You can say draw a picture of a kangaroo riding on a rabbit or something, and it will do that. And so it's exactly whatwe did with proteins. His technique called\"RF Diffusion\" is trained by adding random noise toa known protein structure, and then the AI has to remove this noise. Once trained in thisway, the AI can be asked to produce proteins for various functions. It's given a random noise input, and the AI figures out a brand new protein that does what you asked it to do. This work has huge implications. I mean, imagine you gotbitten by a venomous snake. If you're lucky, you'll haveaccess to anti-venom prepared by milking venom fromthe exact kind of snake, which is then injected into live animals, and the antibodies fromthat animal are extracted and refined and then givento you as an anti-venom. The trouble is often peoplehave allergic reactions to these antibodies from other organisms. But your odds of survivalcan be a lot better with the latest syntheticproteins designed in Baker's lab. They've created humancompatible antibodies that can neutralize lethal snake venom. This anti-venom could bemanufactured in large quantities and easily transported tothe places where it's needed. With these tiny molecular machines, the possibilities are endless. What are the applicationsyou're most excited about? So I think vaccines aregonna be really powerful. We have a number of proteins that are in human clinicaltrials for cancer, and we're working onautoimmune disease now. We're really excited about problems like capturing greenhouse gases. So we're designing enzymes that can fix methane, break down plastic. What makes this approach so effective is how fast they can createand iterate the proteins. It's really quite miraculous for anyone who's aconventional school biochemist or protein scientist. We can now have designs on the computer, get the amino acid sequenceof the design proteins, and then in just a couple dayswe can get the protein out. Yeah. We've given a name to this, which is \"Cowboy Biochemistry\" because we just like, youjust got kind of go for it as fast as you can, and itturns out to work pretty well. What AI has done forproteins is just a hint of what it can do in other fields and on larger scales. In materials science, for example, DeepMind's GNoME program hasfound 2.2 million new crystals, including over 400,000 stable materials that could power future technologies from superconductors to batteries. AI is creating transformativeleaps in science by helping to solve someof the fundamental problems that have blocked human progress. If we think of thewhole tree of knowledge, you know there are certain problems where you know if their root, no problems. If you unlock them, if youdiscover a solution to them, it would unlock a whole newbranch or avenue of discovery. And with this, AI ispushing forward the boundaries of human knowledge at arate never seen before. Speed ups of 2x are nice, they're great, we love them. Speed ups of a 100,000x, change what you do. You do fundamentally different stuff and you start to rebuild your science around the things that got easy. And that's what I'm excited about. These discoveries representreal step function changes in science. Even if AI doesn't advancebeyond where it is today, we will be reaping the benefits of these breakthroughs for decades. And assuming AI does continue to develop, well, it will open up opportunities that were previously thought impossible. Whether that's curing all diseases, creating novel materials, or restoring the environmentto a pristine state. This sounds like an amazing future as long as the AI doesn't take overand destroy us all first. (slow cosmic music)"}]}

The blades will start spinning in 60 seconds,so what do you do? I would like to think I could duck downand miss the blades Break the thing at the bottom maybe? Push the blades? Ask nicely for the blendernot to be turned on. Tie my clothes together, and then likeuse it as a rope I guess? If I was lighter I could maybe catch a draft up? Just accept defeat.- I mean, I'm the size of a nickel what quality of life is that? Okay, resonance. I'm going to run to one wall,push on it, run to the other wall. Push on it. Run to the other wall, soI'm going to tip the container over. Honestly, the thing I would think about is trying to get to the very centerof the blades. It's spinning around me, but the actual RPM is probably not that high,if I'm standing in the middle. I tie my clothes to one of the tipsof the blades as it\u2019s starting up. Yeah, I get it to swingme around and then I woooo! But these answers don't cut it. Now, I first heard about this problemin this book. It describes how each year Google received about 3 million applications,but they would only hire 7000 people. That's a 0.2% acceptance rate. So one way to screen outmillions of applicants was to use brainteasers, and the interviewerswould make these up for fun. We didn't get a list, at that time ofwhat questions to ask. We would share questions among each other. Some of them gained traction,questions like: How many golf balls can fit in a 747? Or, how much should you chargeto wash all the windows in Seattle? But the blender questionreally stuck with me, and I'm not alone. Just lay back and enjoy that breeze.The best model in the world is only going torun maybe 10 or 11 hours, so we're getting out and when we do, we're better off for it because whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. The question has been hotly debatedin Reddit comment sections. There are so many different answers,but which one is the best? I try to hide underneath the blades,I guess. Hide under the blade, probably Great first reaction, but maybe that doesn't solve your problementirely. Now you're just stuck inside of a spinningblender, so maybe you want to escape. Can I climb the walls? Are there defects in the walls that aresufficiently large for me to grip on to? Do I have Van der Waals forces that arestrong enough to connect me to the wall? Am I, like, essentially a tiny gecko? A gecko can stickto the wall of a blender, even though neither its foot, northe glass are charged. The gecko's foot has to be pressedfirmly against the glass, so its atoms are within a few nanometersof the glass atoms. Then, at any moment one atoms electronsaren't uniformly spread about the nucleus, they might be slightly more on oneside than the other. This makes the atom momentarilyslightly positively charged on one side and slightlynegatively charged on the other. The glass atom next to it experiencesthe pull of this charge imbalance, and so a similar chargeimbalance is induced on the glass atom, and therefore the electrons in the glassatom are drawn to the nucleus of the geckoatom, and vice versa. So there is a very weak attractive forcebetween neutral atoms. This is known as a Van der Waals force,and it's what makes geckos stick to walls. It's the same forcethat holds graphite together. There's no actual bonding betweenthe layers of graphene in a pencil. It's like a stack of paper. The layers only stick because of Vander Waals forces. Now these forces are pretty weak. But since we're so small, maybethey'd be enough to help us climb out. This I can almost certainly say,we wouldn't be sticking at that scale, and that's because the Van der Waalstype interactions are still small. And I studied climbing, so that of these types ofscale, cockroach and gecko, you know, it turns out that you have to getvery special to do that. Geckos have millions of tinybranches on their feet that increase their surface areaand allow them to mold to surfaces. Our hands aren't like that,but ants and cockroaches don't rely on Van der Waals forces,and they can still climb up walls. So maybe a miniature human could too? The mechanism of a cockroach foot, and I used to know all thatcockroach feet, is absolutely gorgeous, Same with an ant, by the way. There's two little claws, the tarsal claws those are thingsthat slap down on a surface and really do slap when climbing meters a second... slap andengage, despite having no adhesion, they have very sophisticated,frictional attachment. Those claws can grip almost anything,even glass. While glass feels smooth to us, It's actually covered in tiny surfaceimperfections. At insect scale,these features are significant. Ants basically have climbing gear.- Oh yeah. They're like, using these littlelike axes basically to pick their way in. We don't have the attachment disksor whatever that would be, or like the special clawsor the Van der Waals forces. Well, we have claws, if you're that scale,our fingers are claws. We have only really got... we havetwo claws, really. And then our feetaren't great at climbing, I don't know. Well, again, at that scale though,I don't know, right? Imagine putting a little sharp, spike into your foot and sharpen yourshoes, wear high heel shoes. You'll be good to go. So now I'm climbing in heels. But there's still a problem. I mean, I'll have to be pretty carefulplacing each hand and foot slowly. It's going to take longerthan 60 seconds to get out. And in that time,the blades will have started spinning. One mistake and I'm a smoothie. So Google was lookingfor a different answer. Now we\u2019re going to the physics building.Maybe they know? Yeah. I really got nothing. I\u2019m stumped. This is so embarrassing. We\u2019re in our last year of our degree, we shoulddefinitely know this! I feel like I could probably swing runningaround the sides and yeeting myself out. Okay, if we're just talking about the entropy, it should increase at some point.So some sort of chaos should be... None of the system will stay un-disrupted... Take that as a limit to infinityand I'll be chilling... Like using that logicif I just like extrapolate... Now that's still too big for meto Quantum Tunnel or anything like that. Whoa whoa whoa whoa. I mean, that is really overthinking it. It's actually not that complicated. Do you want to hear the best answer I've heard yet?- Sure. Just jump. Just jump? How would that work? Just jump!- How? -Does that work like that?- Jump where? - Out of the blender, just go up. So whoever told you that is... - ...crazy, right? Yeah, does that makes sense to you? No, it doesn't, but...do you want to hear why that works? Yeah, tell me how it works. Jumping out of a blender seems impossiblebecause at nickel size, the wall of a blender is 15xyour height. It'd be like leaping over an eight story building. But watch these clips... Did you notice it? A horse, a dog and a squirrel. They all jump to about the same height. This is exactly what Alfonso Borrelli,the father of biomechanics, looked at in the 17th century.As he put it, in the same conditions, smaller and lighter animalsmake bigger jumps relative to their body. if the other conditions are equal,and indeed the limbs and the other organs are in the same proportion,the dog will jump as far as the horse. Now, sure, there is variation. A species whose survival depends onjumping will be optimized for it, while others, like turtles and elephants,they don't jump at all. But when you consider the huge variationsin size, I mean a horse is 1500 timesheavier than a squirrel. It's incredible that they jump toaround the same height. And it's not because squirrelsare super muscly or something. Horses and squirrels have similar muscleto weight percentages, and insects have even less musclerelative to their weight. Why do you think an ant can lift50 times its own body weight? Like, is it any more muscular? Noyou guys hit the gym. Come on. Likeyou're more muscular than an ant. So how are small things so strong? Well if you look closely at a muscle. It\u2019s made up of tiny units called sarcomeres. They act like miniature springs. How far a muscle compresses depends onhow many of these springs are in series. But the strength of a muscle dependsonly on how many are working in parallel. The thicker the muscle, the more springsin parallel, and the greater the strength. Therefore strength dependson the cross-sectional area of a muscle. And as animals shrink,this cross-sectional area scales downwith the square of their height. But an animal's weightis proportional to its volume, so that scaleswith the cube of their height. So as you scale down, weight decreasesfaster than strength, and as a result, smaller animals have muchhigher strength to weight ratios. I mean, you could probably lift, your own weight, like if you were to put your own body weight on your back and squat that, you could now lift... 100 hundred times. Yeah. Let's go! And for us, stuck in that blender,that extra strength relative to our weightmeans we could jump right out. Your surface areadecreases with the square. You'd be like a little superman. I see, okay!- That's really cool. So I could jump, like,literally out of a blender. You could jump out of a blender. But in movies and games where people are shrunk,they almost never show it like that. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids It was one of my favorite movieswhen I was a kid. I loved that. Tiny people struggle picking up scissors. They almost get crushed by raindrops. If it was scientifically accurate, they\u2019d actually be overpowered. Most people don't think of thiswhen they first hear the question. The answer almost seems too simple. When you ask the right questions,you define the problem. There's some really obvious solutionsthat work, and that's actually true for a lot of problemsin the real world too. Now I'm all for obvious solutions,but from the start, the answer of jumping outdidn't sit right with me. Even this idea of like, I'mgoing to jump out of the blender like that doesn't make sense to me,because jumping is not just like, okay, how strongyou are relative to your weight. It's also timingand your kinetics and all that. So like, how long can you be intouch with the ground? How much can you apply that force inone burst like over a really short period? Would it befair to say you're overthinking things? You got to suspend your disbeliefsomewhere. I think if you like, factor in all thepotential challenges a human would have. Just like if they just all of a suddenthat size, they don't have like time to practice using their legsand stuff in that new environment. Like, I don't give them very goodchances of jumping out. Sometimes there are peoplewho make everything more complex than it needs to be,and that can be problematic. I would like to see like, you know, realistic modeling of,we scale me down 100 times. Like, can I jump higher? I want to see someone dothose physics equations, yeah, you could jump higher, but you couldn\u2019t jump100x higher, you know? So that's why we got the researchersat Georgia Tech's biomechanics lab to investigate. While, they're figuring that out, let me tell you about today'ssponsor, Incogni.

That's incogni.com/veritasium. Now let's see how thatsimulation is coming along. Okay, so we have our simulated blender. We\u2019re 2 centimeters tall and we have to jump at least 30 centimeters to get out. I was like, well, what about me? Like, I'm pretty,you know, embarrassingly non-athletic. What if I do this? So I did it right herenext to my desk. My partner sort of measured my jump height, and I know how much I weighand all that stuff. So what would it look like for me? If we have a personthat weighs 84kg, is squatting 15cm and has a jump height of 27cm. That person, if they were scaled down to 1% of their original size, they would jump 42cm high. The simple simulationshows a jump height of 42cm. So you would make it out. But we need to add in air resistance. Since our cross-sectional area is now100 times larger relative to our weight, drag should have a greater effectat nickel size. If it was 42cm jump heightbefore for the jumper, with drag... considering drag, then it's about 39cm. So we do decrease in jump height a little bit. But that drag calculationis assuming you jump perfectly vertically. But what if you're a bit uncoordinatedand you flip onto your side mid jump? Well, then you're exposingten times the surface area and that increasesthe amount of air resistance. Like if somehow you flipped,and you're still moving up like this. Like what is the air resistance then? So doing that, that means 22 centimeter jump height. Oh. So we don't we don't. Oh. Darn. If you start getting overconfidentand you wanted to do, like, a backflip while you're at it,then you're going to mess it up. Yeah. Don't backflip out of the blender is a good piece of advice. Don't try and show off. You're trying to not get chopped up. Just like, just go headfirst. It's not so much getting outof the blender. It's what happens next. You've got two nickel sized men freein the world. Think of the posibilities. The simulation came back, You can jump out of the freaking blender. Alright, okay. I'm glad we went through this,this exercise. Do you want me to do another monthof research on this? No. You know, like you've done it. You've done enough.You've done enough. I'm convinced. I feel like jumping isan unsatisfactory answer. It was unsatisfactorywhen you mentioned it in the first place. And you went throughand you got the simulation, you got the model, and you're like, look,you know, our little guy can jump 40cm. Are you convinced now? And I'm like, I guess. But like, my spidey sense was tingling. Oh was it now!- There is something going on... You're telling methat I have to apply a force in 1/1000 of a second,and I have to undergo 278 G's? I'm not going to survive that. So what I'm getting now is that, like,my intuition was good. I think everyone's intuition was like,you can't jump out of a blender. I think they're right. And you may say, well, that's overthinking it,but that's the whole point of the brain teaser is to overthink it is to get tothat point where you're thinking about it in the detail of like,what would actually be feasible. A whole lot of things would go wrong. Our hearts have to generatea certain amount of pressure to get the blood, you know, going upto our head and going all the way down. If you take the human heartand shrink it down, it's not going to be ableto generate the same kinds of forces. I think it would be a catastrophe,in a smaller size. Controlling air pressure inside these countless sacksinside of our lungs. There's an exquisite balance there. Now, you try to take that same designand squeeze it down. I would be skeptical that you'd be ableto keep the passageways open. You wouldn't even be ableto think this through, because you just wouldn't have the brain structures that we have. You can't fit 86 billion neurons in a nickel sized volume. You can't scale cells down either. That's the thing. Like cells are cells. I mean, jumping out would be, to me,seems like your only option, but I don't think you're going to be able to jump because you can't breatheand your heart can't pump blood, so you just keel over and diebefore you can make your jump. Okay, so if you're a biologist,you think we die. If you're a physicist, you can decidewhether we'd be little supermen or, as I believe, incapableof fully harnessing our extra strength. What did Borelli know? He didn't even have blenders. He doesn't know the stress. But if you're an interviewer at Google,you might not even care what the answer is. I think one of the misconceptionsthat candidates have is when I'm asked this question, it'sbecause they want to see if I can solve this problem. That's actually not quite right. There are five attributespeople are looking for. There's addressing ambiguity, There's breaking down the problem,being creative, being smart, and then communication. So I guess like none of those five arewhether it's correct.- Right. We\u2019re the idiots who wentand tried to figure out what's the best of those answers.Um, yes! Google realized that asking these types of questionsdidn't make much sense. Laszlo Bock, the senior vice presidentof people operations at Google, said this: On the hiring side, we found that brainteasers are a complete waste of time. How many golf ballscan you fit into an airplane? How many gas stations are in Manhattan? A complete waste of time.They don't predict anything. They serve primarilyto make the interviewer feel smart. But I just feel like there's that moment where you're like,so are you going to admit you're wrong? And I'm like, nyah, you know, I thinkthis is further to like, I'm not wrong. This is crazy. This question is crazy. And I think it goes to your very point. Your very point,which is that like brain teasers like this are not good ways to assess whether peopleknow what they're talking about. So although brain teasers aren't usefulto assess job applicants,they are useful for something. I mean, every time we ask this questionto people on the street, to physics students and to scientists,they lit up. They had to try to see the worldfrom a new perspective. And it's exactly this way of thinkingthat has led to some of the biggest scientificdiscoveries. Einstein used thought experimentsto come up with his theory of relativity. Euler's solutionto the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg puzzle is what inspired graph theory. And when Schr\u00f6dinger wanted to illustratehis problems with quantum mechanics, he imagined a cat in a torture box. The blender question is admittedly silly,but silly questions can yield profound answersand show us new things. I think in order to learn something new,you have to be willing to embrace the ridiculousand just go with it."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about: Great Stalacpipe Organ"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Derek] There is a limestonecave in Western Virginia where one of its giant chambers has been turned into a musical instrument. They call it an organ, but it's like no otherorgan on the planet. Oh! [Derek] It relies onelectromechanical mallets, steel bolts, electric guitar pickups, and the main vibratingmaterial, limestone. It's more technicallyreferred to as a lithophone, the only one of its kind in the world, but people around herejust call it the organ. So Veritasium producerPetr went to check it out. We're going underground. Let's go. Can you tell me a little bit about the history of this place? Luray Caverns?- Yeah. Discovered 1878, and, in fact, to your right is where they first came in. Oh, no way.- On August 13th, 1878, a group of hunters felta cool breeze coming from a small hole in the ground. Putting down theirrifles, they began to dig, making a hole big enough for the smallest of them to fit through. Andrew and Quint hadonly a candle for light as they lowered themselvesdown into the hole. They spent the next few months exploring. They kept finding giant caverns connected by narrow passageways. The ceilings and floors were covered in stalactites and stalagmites. They even found an underground lake. The cave system they hadaccidentally stumbled upon turned out to be the largestin the Eastern United States, covering 26 hectares. It's now known as the Luray Caverns, and it's visited by half amillion tourists each year. [Larry] That's Dream Lake. [Petr] How still that water is and the reflection is justreally something else. The organ is one of the lower areas. It's in a room called theCathedral, a very large room. [Petr] Yeah, that makes sense. [Larry] And they used tohave dances down there, balls. They used to call it the ballroom before the organ was put in.- Oh, no way. So in the 1920s, peoplewould go down here and have Oh yeah.- balls and dances and Well, it was no-- shindigs. [Larry] It was a great place because it's air conditionedbasically naturally, so. Yeah, that makes sense. Oh my God. Are you kidding me? No way. Oh, this is so gorgeous. (riveting instrumental music) And there's the controlpanel for the organ. That's the organ. You're actually insidethe organ right now. The organ covers three and a half acres. All the notes are scattered out around us. Of course, this was startedin 1954, first played in 1957. Okay. So it tookthree years to get from- Yes. Welcome to thebeautiful caverns of Luray in Luray, Virginia and particularly to the Great Stalacpipe Organ, which is located in this greatcathedral-like structure, which is 260 feet below the surface. This organ is so huge thatyou stand not before it but within it. [Derek] In 1954 while on a tour of the caverns for his son'sbirthday, Leland Sprinkle, a mathematician who workedat the Pentagon, had an idea. See, during the tour, the guide walked aroundwith a small mallet. He would occasionally hit a stalactite, producing a musical tone. This was the start ofSprinkle's three-year project to turn the cave intoa musical instrument. Since you asked for it, weshall be most happy to show you how we make music from theancient stalactites around us. What he did is he walkedaround these caverns with a ladder and climbingequipment and little mallets and little tuning forks, andhe would hit on stalactites. And then when there wasone that was close enough to concert pitch that he wanted, he'd take a disc grinderand grind off the stalactite until it came to the pitch that he wanted. So this one should be middle C. (soft jaunty music)(sound chimes) Stalactites form very slowly. In this cave, they grow at around 16 cubiccentimeters every 120 years. The rate is dependent on theamount of water that flows. So some stalactites grow quickly while others don't really grow at all. They form as slightly acidicwater flows through the ground. It dissolves the limestoneand then redeposits it when it comes in contact with the air. As the water drips to the ground, it can also deposit thelimestone on the floor, leading to a stalagmite. Sometimes over thousandsof years, the stalactite and stalagmite can fusetogether, forming a column. You don't need to be livingin an underground cave to know that cybersecurity is important. One of the things you can doto keep your identity safe is to use a virtual privatenetwork like our sponsor, NordVPN. It hides your IP address, and one thing I love about NordVPN is how fast their speeds are, which is especially useful when connecting to streaming services in faraway locations to watch content that's onlyavailable in those regions. I've been traveling around a lot recently, but hockey season has started. So I've been using NordVPN to watch NHL Games whileI'm here in Australia. Go Canucks. I just connect to theNordVPN servers in the US, and then I can see everything I want. So to try it out for yourself, go to nordvpn.com/veritasium. If you click that link in the description, you'll get a huge discounton a two-year plan plus an extra four months free. So use our link, nordvpn.com/veritasium for the best deal out there on NordVPN. There is a 30-day money back guarantee, so it's entirely risk free. I wanna thank NordVPN forsponsoring this part of the video, and now back to the cave. (soft chiming music) If you tap on a stalactite,then like a tuning fork, it vibrates at its resonant frequency. That frequency depends on the size and shape of the stalactite. Bigger stalactites make lower notes, and it also depends on theelastic modulus of the material. In this case, it's all limestone. So to adjust the resonant frequencies, Sprinkle shaved a bit offthe end of some stalactites, putting them into concert pitch. The organ wasn't connected tothe console when we visited, so Petr didn't get a chance to play it. But Rob Scallon, who hasa great YouTube channel, made a video about it a couple years ago. We asked him what it'slike to play a cave. It's hard to describe thefeeling of playing a cave. (keys echo) It's very like grounding,very surreal, very beautiful. You know, if I'm being romantic about it, you can hear the eonsand eons and eons of time that were needed to create this thing. The cave is, of course, huge, and all the notes are in different places. So some are further away. Some are closer. Some are amplified near you,some aren't, and I love reverb, and the amount of reverb inthis room is just so immense, and the notes are so pure and beautiful, and they're in different places. So they like have different reverb. It's a very like hauntinglybeautiful type of sound. As you can see,there's also the solenoid that is basically a mallet. [Leland] After thetuning has been completed, we design a custom built bracket to which we attach anelectrically operated plunger. This plunger with its rubbertip strikes the stalactite, causing it to vibrate. [Derek] Since differentmusical stalactites are far away from each otherand their volume variable, Sprinkle amplified the vibrations. He could've used microphones,but in the 1950s, those weren't particularly robust. So instead, he borrowedan idea from a piece of technology invented in the 1930s, the electric guitar pickup. (upbeat electric guitar music) A guitar pickup is a coil ofwire wrapped around a magnet. When a steel guitarstring vibrates near it, it interacts with the magnetic field, which induces a current in the wire. It doesn't work withnon-metal guitar strings. The thing that's vibratingneeds to be ferromagnetic. Sprinkle added a steel bolt to each of his musical stalactites and then used a pickupto detect the vibrations. These signals are amplified mixed and played back through speakers. You also gotta consider the weight of the bolt that goes into. Oh, right.- Yeah. [Derek] But the guitar pickups created an unexpectedproblem, radio interference. I don't know exactly how it works, but one of the keys was pickingup a local radio station, which actually turned it into a sampler. It was a really fun part of the video and actually sounded pretty cool. That happens with electronicinstruments sometimes, even caves. (laughs) (keys echo)(muffled singing echoes) What is that? It happensevery time I hit that key. (keys echo)(muffled singing echoes) I'm like turning on the radio. [Man] It is picking up on that signal. (people laugh) Oh my God.- That is what it is. You're getting keys. So the radio is here. (voices echoes) I thought, I'm like,\"Is that a human voice?\" Like is that- That would be the AM radio.AM station across the street. [Petr] If they weretuned in, you know, 1957, have they become longerand hence gone out of tune? Well, he tried to pickstalactites that are inactive, that aren't growing anymoreis what he tried to do. [Petr] But if he foundstalactites that were growing 'cause I'm seeing like alittle bit of water, right? Yeah, and you'll see-- There's a little bit of growth happening.- Right, and you'll see that,and that comes and goes, but we've never had to retune one yet. Like I love the ideathat there's an organ that could grow out of tune- It could. because of how stalactites grow. I don't think it'll be inmy lifetime, but it could. (Larry chuckles) If he chose a bunchthat weren't inactive, it would be out of tune already. [Larry] Oh yeah. If they were completelyactive, it would be. That's so cool.- It's very mad scientist. He definitely couldn'tget away with it now, like going into a place like this and then just starting toshave off the stalactites that took eons to be created by nature. Thankfully it stays in tune 'cause I can't continue shavingoff the parts of this cave. This is just such astrange and beautiful and kind of insane projectto take this gorgeous cavern and make it even more beautiful by turning into a musical instrument. This structure has beenbeing created drop by drop for an unfathomable amount of years, and that's pretty awe inspiring. (electronic beeps trill)(organ keys echo)"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a Veritasium-style video script about:  mathematical impossibilities and challenges inherent in various democratic voting systems."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "human nature nor a statement about how rare and unstable Democratic societies have been in the history of civilization our current attempt at democracy the methods we're using to elect our leaders are fundamentally irrational and this is a well-established mathematical fact this is a video about the math that proved that fact and led to a Nobel Prize it's a video about how groups of people make decisions and the pitfalls that our voting systems fall into one of the simplest ways to hold an election is to ask the voters to mark one candidate as their favorite on a ballot and when the votes are counted the candidate with the most votes wins the election this is known as first past the post voting the name is kind of a misnomer though there is no post that any of the candidates need to get past. the winner is just the candidate with the most votes this method likely goes back to Antiquity it has been used to elect members of the House of Commons in England since the 14th century and it's still a common voting system with 44 countries in the world using it to elect its leaders 30 of these countries were former British colonies the us being a former British colony still uses first past the post in most of its states to elect their representatives to the electoral college but first pass the post has problems if you are selecting representatives in a parliament you can and frequently do get situations where the majority of the country did not vote for the party that ends up holding the power in the last 100 years there were 21 times a single party held a majority of the seats in the British Parliament but only two of those times did the majority of the voters actually vote for that party so a party which only a minority of the people voted for ends up holding all of the power in government another thing that happens because of first pass the post is that similar parties end up stealing votes from each other the 2000 US presidential election which was an election essentially between Al Gore and George W bush at that point every state in the nation used first pass the post to determine the outcome of the election bush had more votes in Florida but by a ridiculously slim margin it was fewer than 600 votes but there was another candidate on the ballot Ralph Nader. Nader was a green candidate he was certainly to the left of either Gore or bush what we need is the upsurge of Citizen concern people concerned poor Rich or middle class to counteract the power of the special interest and he got almost 100,000 votes in Florida I just don't know if I can with a conscience um vote for uh Bush or Gore I will vote for Ralph Nader most of those voters were devastated that by voting for Nader rather than Gore they ended up electing Bush This is what is called a spoiler effect almost all Nader voters preferred Gore to Bush but in a first pass post system they had no way of expressing that preference because you could only vote for one candidate so first pass the post incentivizes voters to vote strategically say there are five parties one of them will be the smallest one and so they won't win why would you vote for them this is also true if you have four parties or three parties this Winner Takes all voting system leads to a concentration of power in larger parties eventually leading to a two party system this effect is common enough that it has a name do verger's law so first pass the post isn't a great option so what else could we do well we can say that a candidate can only win an election if they get a majority at least 50% plus one of the vote but what if we hold an election and no one gets a majority we could go to the people who voted for the candidate with the fewest votes and ask ask them to vote again but choose a different candidate and we could repeat this process over and over eliminating the smallest candidate until one candidate reaches a majority but holding many elections is a big hassle so instead we could just ask voters to rank their preferences from their favorite to their least favorite and if their favorite candidate gets eliminated we go to their second preferences when the polls close you count the voters first choices if any c cidate has a majority of the votes then they're the winner but If no candidate has a majority the candidate with the fewest votes gets eliminated and their ballots are distributed to those voters second preferences and this keeps happening until one candidate has a majority of the votes this is mathematically identical to holding repeated elections it just saves the time and hassle so it's referred to as instant runoff but the system is also known as preferential voting or ranked Choice voting an instant runoff doesn't just affect the voters it affects how the candidates behave towards each other it was the Minneapolis mayor's race 2013 they were using rank Choice voting the incumbent mayor had stepped down and there were all of these people came out from the woodwork wanting to be mayor there 35 candidates and so you would think if there's 35 candidates you'd want to dunk on someone you'd want to like kind of elbow yourself into the spotlight that's not what happened these 35 candidates all of them were really nice to each other they were all super cordial super polite to the degree that at the end of the final mayoral debate they all came together and they sang Kumbaya together k k oh Lord the amount of vitriol and anger and partisan you know mudslinging that we're all used to to see this vision of an actual Kumbaya it's not even a joke all of these people getting along so desperate for second and third choices from other people that they're like I'm going to be the picture perfect kindest candidate possible but there's also a problem with instant runoff there can be cases where a candidate doing worse can actually help help get them elected let's say we have three candidates Einstein curee and bore now Einstein and bore have very conflicting views while C is ideologically in the center so let's say Einstein gets 25% of the vote cirri gets 30 and bore gets 45 no one got a majority so it goes to the second round with Einstein being eliminated and because people who voted for Einstein put down c as their second choice well C ultimately gets elected but now imagine that bour has a terrible campaign speech or proposes a very unpopular policy so bad that some of his voters actually switch over to Einstein's side well now it's curee that gets eliminated and because she's more moderate half of her voters select Einstein and the other half select bore in the second round and this leads to boore winning so bore doing work in the first round actually leads to him winning the election clearly this isn't something that we want in a voting system this is what the french mathematician Condor also thought Condor was one of the first people applying logic and Mathematics to rigorously study voting systems making him one of the founders of a branch of mathematics known as social Choice theory he was working during the time of the French Revolution so fairly determining the will of the people was having a cultural moment right then in 1784 condor's contemporary at the French Royal Society of science Jean Charles de borda proposed a voting method you ask the voters to rank the candidates if there are five candidates ranking someone first gives that candidate Four Points ranking them second would give them three and so on with zero points being awarded for last place but the board account has a problem because the number of points given to each candidate is dependent on the total number of candidates adding extra people that have no chance of winning can affect the winner because of this condr hated Border's idea he wrote that it was bound to lead to error because it relies on irrelevant factors for its judgments so in 1785 Condor published an essay in which he proposed a new voting system one he thought was the most Fair basically the winner needs to beat every other candidate in a head-to-head election but with more than two candidates do you need to hold a large number of head-to-head elections to pick the winner well no just ask the voters to rank their preferences just like in instant runoff and then count how many voters rank each candidate higher than each other candidate this feels like the most Fair voting [Music] method this voting system was actually discovered 450 years earlier by Raymond lull a monk who was looking at how church leaders were chosen but L's ideas didn't make an impact because his book ours electionus the art of Elections was lost and only rediscovered in 2001 so the voting system is named after cond and not lol but will there always be a winner in this way let's try condor's method for choosing dinner between you and two friends there are three options burgers pizza or sushi you really like burgers so that's your first preference your second choice is pizza and you put Sushi last your friend prefers pizza then Sushi then burgers and your other friend prefers Sushi than Burgers then pizza now if you choose Burgers it can be argued that Sushi should have won instead since two of you prefer Sushi over burgers and only one prefers Burgers to Sushi however by the same argument Pizza is preferred to Sushi and burgers are preferred to Pizza by a margin of 2: one on each occasion so it seems like you and your friends are stuck in a loop burgers are preferred to Pizza which is preferred to Sushi which is preferred to Burgers and so on this situation is known as condor's Paradox Condor died before he could resolve this problem with his voting system he was politically active during the French Revolution writing a draft of France's Constitution in 1793 during the reign of terror when Le monang came to power he was deemed a traitor for criticizing the regime specifically their new constitution the next year he was arrested and died in jail over the next 150 years dozens of mathematicians were proposing their own voting systems or modifications to Condor or bord ideas one of those mathematicians was Charles Dodson better known as Lewis Carroll when he wasn't writing Alice in Wonderland he was trying to find a system to hold Fair elections but every voting system had similar kinds of problems you'd either get Condor Loops or other candidates that had no chance of winning would affect the outcome of the election in 1951 Kenneth Arrow published his PhD thesis and in it he outlined five very obvious and reasonable conditions that AR voting system should have condition number one if everyone in the group chooses one option over another the outcome should reflect that if every individual in the group prefers to eat sushi over pizza then the group as a whole should prefer Sushi over Pizza this is known as unanimity condition two no single person's vote should override the preferences of everyone else if everyone votes for pizza except one person who votes for sushi the group should obviously choose Pizza if a single vote is decisive that's not a democracy that's a dictatorship condition three everyone should be able to vote however they want and the voting system must produce a conclusion for society based on all the ballots every time it can't avoid problematic ballots or candidates by simply ignoring them or just guessing randomly it must reach the same answer for the same set of ballots every time this is called unrestricted domain condition four the voting system should be transitive if a group prefers Burgers over pizza and pizza over Sushi then they should also prefer Burgers over Sushi this is known as transitivity condition five if the preference of the group is Sushi over Pizza the introduction of another option like burgers should not change that preference sure the group might collectively rank Burgers above both or in the middle or at the bottom but the ranking of sushi over Pizza should not be affected by the new option this is called the independence of irrelevant Alternatives but here's the thing Arrow proved that satisfying all five of these conditions in a ranked voting system with three or more candidates is impossible this is Arrow's impossibility theorem and it was so groundbreaking that Arrow was awarded the Nobel prize in economics in 1972 so I want to go through a version of his proof based on a formulation by GN acus so let's say there are three candidates running for election Aristotle bore and C but we'll refer to them as a b and c and we have a collection of Voters that will line up in order so we have voter 1 2 3 and so on all the way up to n each of these voters is free to rank a b and c however they like I'll even allow ties now the first thing we want to show is that if everyone ranks a particular candidate first or last then society as a whole must also rank that candidate first or last let's arbitrarily pick candidate B if say half of the voters rank B first and half rank B last then the claim is our voting system must put B either first or last and we'll prove it by contradiction so say this is how everyone voted if our system does not put B first or last but rather in the middle say a is ranked above B which is above C then we'll get a contradiction because if each of our voters moved C above a then by unanimity C must be ranked above a however because we didn't change the position of any a relative to B A must still be ranked above B and because we didn't change the position of any c relative to B C must still be ranked below B and by transitivity if a is preferred to B and B is preferred to C then a must be ranked above C but this contradicts the result by unanimity and that proves that if everyone ranks a candidate first or last then Society must also rank them first or last now let's do a thought experiment where every voter puts B at the bottom of their ranking we leave the ranking of A and C arbitrary well then by unanimity we know that b must be at the bottom of society's ranking we'll call this setup profile 0 now we'll create profile one which is identical to profile Z except the first voter moves B from the bottom to the top this of course doesn't affect the outcome but we can keep doing this creating profiles 2 3 4 and so on with one more voter of clipping B from the bottom to the top each time if we keep doing this there will eventually come a voter whose change from having B at the bottom to B at the top will first flip society's ranking moving B to the top let's call this voter the pivotal voter and we'll label the profile profile P profile o is then the profile right before the pivotal change happens let's now create a profile Q which is the same as P except the pivotal voter moves a above B by independence of irrelevant Alternatives the social rank must also put a above B since for all of our voters the relative position of A and B is the same as it was in profile O and B must be ranked above C because the relative positions of B and C are the same as they were in profile P where our pivotal voter moved B to the Top by transitivity a must be ranked above C in the social ranking this is true regardless of how any of the non-pivotal voters rearrange their positions of A and C because these rearrangements don't change the position of a relative to B or C relative to B this means the pivotal voter is actually a dictator for determining society's preference of a over C the social rank will always agree with a pivotal voter regardless of what the other voters do we can run a similar thought experiment where we put C at the bottom and prove that there is again a dictator who in this case determines the social preference of A over B and it turns out this voter is the same one who determines the social preference for a over C the pivotal voter is therefore a complete dictator so is democracy doomed well arrows impossibility theorem seems to say so if there are three or more candidates to choose from there is no ranked Choice method to rationally aggregate voter preferences you always need to give something [Music] up but the mathematician Duncan black found a much more optimistic theorem which might actually represent reality better if voters and candidates are naturally spread along a single Dimension say ranging from Liberal on the left to conservative on the right but this could apply to any other political Dimension well then black showed that the preference of the median voter will reflect the majority decision the median voters choice will often determine the outcome of the election a result that aligns with the majority of Voters avoiding the paradoxes and inconsistencies highlighted by arrow and there's more good news Arrow's impossibility theorem only applies to ordinal voting systems ones in which the voters rank candidates over others there is another way rated voting systems the simplest version is known as approval voting where instead of ranking the candidates the voters just tick the candidates they approve of there are also versions where you could indicate how strongly you like each candidate say from minus 10 strongly disapprove of to plus 10 strongly approve research has found that approval voting increases voter turnout decreases negative campaigning and prevents the spoiler effect voters could express their approval for a candidate without worrying about the size of the party they're voting for it's also simple to tally just count up what percentage of the voters approve of each candidate and the one with the highest approval wins Kenneth Arrow was initially skeptical of rated voting systems but toward the end of his life he agreed that they were likely the best method approval voting is not new it was used by priests in the Vatican to elect the pope between 1294 and 1621 it's also used to elect the Secretary General of the United Nations but it hasn't been widely used in large scale elections and so more real real world testing is likely required so is democracy mathematically impossible well yes if we use rank Choice methods of voting which is what most countries in the world use to elect their leaders and some methods are clearly better at aggregating the people's preferences than others the use of first past the post voting feels quite frankly ridiculous to me given all of its flaws but just because things aren't perfect doesn't mean we shouldn't try being interested in the world around us caring about issues and being politically engaged is important it might be one of the few ways we can make a real difference in the world like Winston Churchill said democracy is the worst form of government except for all the other forms that have been tried democracy is not perfect but it's the best thing we've got the game

And why don't we have anything better? In the early 1980s, most rechargeable batteries were stuck at just 40 to 60 watt hours per kilogram, meaning you would need a kilogram of battery to power a 40 watt light bulb for just an hour. As a result, when the first commercial mobile phone launched in 1983, it was pretty unimpressive. It took 10 hours to charge for just 30 minutes of talk time. Laptops, cameras, even medical devices all suffered from the same bulky batteries. Everyone from electronics giants to oil companies were trying to make a better battery, because they knew that even just doubling the energy density could unlock a new era of portable electronics and power the digital revolution. But what no one realized is that someone had already found the solution. In 1972, a 32-year-old British chemist named Stanley Whittingham was studying how different materials store energy at Exxon's research lab in New Jersey. Yes, that Exxon, the multinational oil giant, then the largest oil company in the world. They were researching batteries. The next year, war broke out between Egypt, Syria, and Israel. When the US backed Israel, Arab oil producers cut off oil exports in retaliation. And on December 22nd, the price of crude oil more than doubled from $5.12 a barrel to 11.65. In response, President Nixon created policies to try to keep oil prices down, but they backfired and the shortage only got worse. Americans were left queuing for hours at gas stations as the government introduced a rationing program. It got so bad that they even dropped the national speed limit to 55 miles per hour just to cut consumption. At Exxon, executives were worried that supplies would run out entirely, so they started looking seriously at alternatives, like electricity. This wasn't a new idea. In fact, in 1900 when cars were first taking off, the top selling car was electric, ahead of steam and gas powered cars. But the problem with these electric cars was their batteries. They weighed 360 kilograms, around 40% of the car's weight, but they could only take you around 60 kilometers. And the energy density wasn't just low, it also degraded over time. Every time you recharged, it got worse. After fewer than 500 charges, your range would've dropped to about 40 kilometers. So by 1924, gas powered cars outnumbered electric 10,000 to one. But now that the oil supplies were running out, it seemed to Exxon that there was no other solution than to bring back the electric car, and to do that, they needed a battery with a much higher energy density. So suddenly, Whittingham's side project became a top priority. Exxon poured in resources, giving him free reign to, in his words, \"Do pretty much what I wanted, as long as it did not involve petroleum.\" The very first battery dates back to a curious incident in the 1780s when Italian scientist Luigi Galvani was dissecting a frog to study its anatomy. He anchored one side of the frog on a brass hook and went to cut it open with a steel scalpel. But when he touched the scalpel to the frog's leg, he noticed it suddenly twitched, as if it had come back to life. Galvani believed he'd discovered a sort of animal electricity, a living force produced by the tissue itself. But Galvani's rival Alessandro Volta disagreed. He thought it came from the metals themselves. And you can see this with lots of different materials. Veritasium producer Gregor set up a version No text of this experiment, minus the frog, to test it out. - [Gregor] I have zinc, magnesium, and iron here. I can take any of these metals, stick them into one side of a lemon and stick some copper on the other side. If I hook these up to a volt meter, I should be getting a voltage. And we got around 0.8 volts. Now, the reason this happens is because some elements want to get rid of their electrons more than others. So if you pair one that really doesn't want its electrons with one that really wants some, well, then the electrons are gonna be traveling across. - [Narrator] Let's look at the zinc. What's happening here is that zinc is losing its electrons. The zinc ions enter the juice, and the electrons are forced to go through the circuit to get to the other side. There, hydrogen ions in the lemon juice want those electrons, so they receive them and turn into hydrogen gas. You've got one side that gives up electrons, that's the anode, and you've got one that receives them, that's the cathode. - But why do you need the lemon at all? If there's no flow of the positive ions through to the other side, the electrons stop moving almost immediately. This happens because all of the electrons now get bunched up in the copper, making it extremely negatively charged, and that is just gonna push away any more electrons from coming over to the other side. - [Derek] That's because electrons can't travel through lemon juice. Liquids like this don't have free electrons the way metals do, so electrons stay in the wire. They'll only leave the circuit at the copper side if there's something in the juice, like hydrogen ions ready to take them, and if the reaction releases enough energy to make that transfer happen. But positive ions in the juice can move. They travel across to balance the charge, allowing the current to keep flowing. A solution that carries charge this way by moving ions is called an electrolyte. - But we could also do this with the other metals to get a similar reaction, and we can actually quantify how much each of these metals wants or doesn't want electrons. With zinc, we already got around 0.9 volts, but if you try it with iron, for example, you get something lower, 0.5 or 0.6 volts. Now, magnesium is tricky and it would be a bit higher, but it oxidizes so quickly that even if I scrape some of the oxide from the surface, I'm still getting only around 0.7 volts. The idea is that the larger the voltage on the volt meter, the more energy each electron has to give as it passes through the circuit. But there's also a limit to this. See, this beaker is full of lemon juice from the lemons we used earlier, and they're hooked up using spoons and these wires to a variable power source. Now look what happens when I up the voltage. You'll actually start to see bubbles forming on both spoons, and that's water in the lemon juice actually being broken down into oxygen and hydrogen gas. This already starts happening at 1.23 volts, and that sets a limit on how much voltage you can push through this electrolyte. - Up until the early 1970s, just about every commercial battery No text used a water-based electrolyte, and as a result, none of these battery cells could push much beyond the 1.23 volt limit. Now, the total energy a battery can store depends on how much energy each charge has to give times how much charge can move, that is the battery's voltage times its capacity. So if you can't increase the voltage, your only option is to make more battery, more cells or bigger cells, but that won't increase the energy density. And this is exactly the problem Whittingham was trying to solve. He was searching for materials that could store large amounts of energy in a compact space with light weight. That led him to a class of compounds called transition metal dichalcogenides. He zeroed in on one in particular, titanium disulfide. Titanium in this compound has effectively lost four electrons, two to each sulfur atom, meaning it sits at a plus four oxidation state. That leaves it very electron hungry, exactly what you want in a battery cathode. But titanium disulfide has a second key advantage, this material is made of stacked layers held together by weak Van der Waals forces. This creates natural gaps between sheets of titanium and sulfur atoms just wide enough to let certain ions slip between the layers, a process known as intercalation. Better still, the structure can expand and contract repeatedly without breaking down. Now Whittingham just had to decide which ions to use. He initially looked at potassium, but it was just too reactive and far too dangerous to work with. Oh, yeah! (laughs) - He turned to this, a soft, silvery metal called lithium. What makes lithium unique is not the fact that it has one electron in its outer shell that it wants to get rid of. No, that it shares with the other elements in its group. What sets it apart is how much energy you can get out of lithium when it reacts in a battery. See, when it loses that outer electron, it forms a tiny, incredibly stable positive ion, and so that reaction paired with the right cathode releases more energy per electron than any other metal. That's why it produces the highest voltage of any metal used in batteries. And because it's so small with just three protons, lithium is also the least dense metal, at just 0.53 grams per cubic centimeter. This combination of low density and the tendency to give away its electron made lithium perfect for Whittingham's vision of this high energy density battery. But while lithium was easier to work with than potassium, easier still didn't mean easy. I mean, they only let me hold it in this glove box, and matter of fact, here's what happens to lithium if you put it in a glass of water. (water bubbles) (tense music) Safe to say, you don't want this happening inside your battery. - So, Whittingham had to switch out the water-based electrolyte for something else, and that change unlocked the possibility of higher voltages. He turned to a solution of lithium salt in an organic solvent, and it worked, but it came with serious risks. The solvent was volatile, the lithium salt was chemically unstable. Together, they formed a mixture that could explode or release toxic fumes if mishandled. Everything had to be done with extreme caution. A stray spark or a trace of moisture could destroy the experiment or start a fire. But if you could get around the danger, this new electrolyte was a huge perk. It let lithium-ions shuttle between electrodes without breaking down the solvent or the cell, at least not until much higher voltages. Whittingham had unlocked lithium's potential, and in the process, he'd broken through the 1.23 volt ceiling. His new chemistry delivered nearly double, a huge 2.4 volts per cell. No text He now had a working prototype, a metallic lithium anode on one side, a titanium disulfide cathode on the other, his new liquid electrolyte in between. There was also a thin porous separator that kept the electrodes apart, so they couldn't touch and short circuit. Here's how it works. When you close the circuit, lithium atoms at the anode give up their electrons. Those electrons travel through the external circuit toward the cathode, generating a current that powers whatever's connected. At the same time, the lithium-ions are released into the electrolyte, and then they pass through the porous separator and migrate toward the cathode. The electrons arriving through the circuit are taken up by the titanium atoms and the titanium disulfide. The positive lithium-ions slide between the layers to balance out the negative charge of the electrons, and they become locked in place. And this process is reversible. When you apply a voltage to recharge, the extra electrons are stripped from the titanium and pulled back to the anode. The lithium-ions are forced out of the titanium disulfide layers into the electrolyte, and they too migrate to the anode where metallic lithium reforms. What Whittingham had created here was a rechargeable battery, one that worked reliably cycle after cycle with incredible consistency. I don't normally think about batteries this way, but what they really are is tiny little contained chemical reactions. And in a chemical reaction, if you could get a 60% yield, that would be considered good. But in a battery, especially one that you wanna recharge 1000 times, you need that reaction to be say 99.9% efficient, because if it's not, the capacity of that battery rapidly deteriorates. If you have, say, a 95% yield, then you'd lose a significant fraction of lithium-ions every cycle. After just 50 cycles, you'd only have 8% of your original capacity left. So that's pretty incredible that every single lithium-ion has to leave one electrode, pass through the electrolyte, and slot neatly into the layered crystal structure of titanium disulfide. And then when you recharge it, they have to leave again cleanly without incident, without getting stuck, make their way all the way back to the anode. Amazingly, despite just being an early prototype, Whittingham's battery came close to that 99%. No text In the winter of 1973, Exxon's managers summoned Whittingham to the company's New York office. Whittingham later said, \"I went in there and explained it, five minutes, 10 minutes at the most, and within a week they said yes, they wanted to invest in this.\" They got to work at the Exxon laboratory, but it wasn't all smooth sailing. Firefighters had to be called out repeatedly. They were called so often, they threatened to start charging the lab for the special chemicals needed to extinguish the burning lithium. - The problem was the anode. Whittingham's design used pure lithium, which worked brilliantly, until it didn't. - [Billy] We've made a special cell. We've made a transparent battery. - [Gregor] That's so cool. - But they're very, very small, so we have a microscope lens just to allow us to see it. What you're seeing here is a piece of copper, which we're gradually plating with lithium. So this is analogous to the first generation lithium metal batteries, which use lithium metal as the anode. On this side, we have a piece of lithium. As we charge the battery, we're stripping the lithium from that electrode and we're plating it. And actually what's happening right now is the ideal reaction where it's very slow. We're getting a dense plate. The challenge then becomes if we go too fast. - [Gregor] Oh, that is huge! - Everything's fine until all of a sudden it's not fine. So we want the lithium to plate evenly across everywhere, but instead, it forms in that one location, and that is what is a lithium dendrite. That lithium dendrite can grow. The length scales of this is on the order of, you know, millimeters, so that would've easily short circuited the battery. - [Gregor] And that dendrite can just keep growing, and eventually it's gonna poke through the separator and reach to the other side. Now the electrons are gonna have a shortcut, so instead of going through the circuit, they race straight from the anode to the cathode using the dendrite, and that sudden surge of electrons cause intense heating, and that can trigger a chain reaction inside the battery, leading to a fire, or even an explosion. - For all its promise, Whittingham's battery was just too dangerous, and then the oil crisis ended. Prices dropped and Exxon's urgency evaporated. The company shut down its lithium battery program. Whittingham published his design in 1976, and Exxon licensed the patent to a few manufacturers, but with no funding and no momentum, the first lithium battery revolution died before it had a chance to take off. Fortunately, a copy of Whittingham's paper No text made it across the Atlantic to Oxford University in England, where it caught the attention of John B. Goodenough, an American physicist leading a solid state chemistry group. As he read the paper, one thing stood out, the cell voltage was being held back. The material Whittingham chose for the cathode, titanium disulfide, capped the cell at just 2.4 volts, but Goodenough believed that with a better cathode material, he could do better. He had previously worked with compounds called transition metal oxides. They were more stable than sulfides, and some he knew were extremely hungry for electrons, perfect for a cathode. He tried one of these compounds in his battery, and the voltage immediately spiked from 2.4 volts to four volts. This jump was incredible. But what was even more surprising was the fact that this compound already had lithium in it. The material was lithium cobalt oxide. Lithium cobalt oxide is arranged so that the cobalt and oxygen atoms form tightly bonded layers, with lithium-ions nestled in between. This means that your supply of lithium-ions doesn't just have to come from the dangerous lithium metal on the anode side, it's already there prebuilt into the cathode. So theoretically, you don't even need lithium metal at all. You could assemble the cell in a discharged state with all your lithium-ions in the cathode, then when you connect it to a charger, these ions will get expelled from the cathode crystal lattice and into the electrolyte. At the same time, nearby cobalt atoms will give up an electron to balance out the charge, and those electrons then go through the wire to the anode to meet with the ions. If Goodenough could find an anode that would replace lithium metal, the battery would become safe enough to leave the lab and actually power real world devices. Goodenough was so excited about the potential of his design that he reached out to battery companies across the US, the UK and Europe, but incredibly, no one was interested. So he asked Oxford to file a patent, but they refused. So he took it to a government lab near Oxford, the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, and finally, they agreed to fund the patent, but only if Goodenough signed away his financial rights. Seeing no other option, he agreed, and the lab patented the invention in 1981. Now, this should have been a gold mine, but the lab didn't realize what they had. And so for the second time, the lithium battery revolution was boxed up and shelved. This should have been a turning point for battery science, but bureaucracy and inertia stalled progress. Every field has its bottlenecks. For batteries, it was slow moving institutions. For developers today, it's slow moving code reviews. And I can relate. When we make these videos, especially the ones with simulations or complex animations, it's rarely the ideas that slow us down, it is the reviews. Developers face the same thing. They're writing code faster than ever, thanks to tools like Copilot and Cursor. But code reviews, well, they're still manual and still slow. That's where this video's sponsor CodeRabbit comes in. CodeRabbit automates code reviews with generative AI. Unlike basic tools, it understands your code base, your architecture, standards, even naming conventions. It pulls context from over 40 sources to give feedback that feels precise and human and tailored to your team, right in the Git workflow. That's why it catches what other tools miss, logic errors, bad conditions, math mistakes, even security vulnerabilities, like SQL injections. The result? Well, your senior engineers spend less time buried in reviews and more time solving the problems that only humans can solve. Try it out at CodeRabbit.link/veritasium to cut code review time and bugs in half. And if you're working on open source projects, it's completely free. That's CodeRabbit.link/veritasium. I would like to thank CodeRabbit for sponsoring this part of the video. And now back to Goodenough's design, a breakthrough with nowhere to go, yet. No text While Goodenough's battery design was gathering dust, 10,000 kilometers away in Japan, a 34-year-old chemist named Akira Yoshino was trying to find a safer battery anode, one that didn't require lithium metal. Yoshino was actually looking at plastic. Now, normally plastic is an insulator, but the kind Yoshino was looking at is different. It's called polyacetylene, and its carbon atoms are arranged in a repeating chain of single and double bonds, a structure that gives it unusual electronic properties. If you tweak polyacetylene by adding or removing electrons, electrons can actually move along this carbon chain. So the plastic conducts electricity like a metal. And that got Yoshino thinking, what if polyacetylene could work as a battery anode? During charging, it could absorb lithium-ions and electrons, and then during discharge, it would give up those electrons to the circuit, just like lithium metal does. If it worked, it could eliminate the most dangerous part of the battery, the metallic lithium. But for months, Yoshino struggled. Obviously, since he removed lithium metal from the anode, he had to get lithium-ions from somewhere else and he couldn't figure it out. And then just as he was losing hope, on the last workday of 1982 while cleaning out his office, he stumbled upon a 1980 paper by John B. Goodenough. It described a cathode made of lithium cobalt oxide, a cathode that already contained lithium. This was the missing piece. He sketched out the reaction between lithium cobalt oxide and his lithium free anode, and then built a test cell using the two materials. It worked safely and reliably, but Yoshino wasn't satisfied. The material he used for the anode, the polyacetylene had an extremely low density. I mean, it couldn't pack in enough lithium, so the energy density of the battery was terrible. Yoshino needed something more lightweight, compact, conductive, and crucially, something that could reversibly accept and release lithium-ions within its structure without breaking down. He tested material after material, and every single one failed, until a breakthrough came from within his own company. Another team had developed a new form of carbon with a unique crystalline structure. They called it vapor grown carbon fiber. He got his hands on a sample, tried it in the lab, and it worked. To prove it, he placed a test cell containing metallic lithium into a safety rig, one that's designed to test explosives. Then he dropped a heavy iron rod onto it. It exploded violently. Then he ran the same test again, but this time with his new design, using carbon as the anode. He charged the cell, placed it in the rig, and dropped the rod but nothing happened. The contrast was undeniable. Later, Yoshino would say, \"That was the moment when the lithium-ion battery was born.\" But his employer, Asahi Chemical, well, they weren't a battery company, and they didn't know how to make batteries. So in 1986, Asahi executive Isao Kuribayashi flew to Boston on a top secret mission, carrying three jars containing cathode, anode and electrolyte materials. He handed them to a tiny firm called Battery Engineering, working out of a converted truck garage, and he asked them to turn the materials into cylindrical cells, like the kind you might buy for a flashlight. The team did just that, completely unaware of what they were handling. It wasn't until 2020 that employees learned the truth that they had helped assemble the world's first pre-production lithium-ion batteries. Two weeks later, Kuribayashi returned to Japan with 200 finished perfectly functioning cells. Even then, Asahi's leadership hesitated. Kuribayashi refused to give up. On the 21st of January, 1987, he visited Sony and he took one of the prototype cells and rolled it across the conference table to the Sony execs, and at last, they saw its potential. They reworked the design, swapping out Yoshino's carbon material for graphite that could better intercalate lithium-ions between its layers. And in 1991, Sony launched the first commercial lithium-ion battery inside this, the Sony Handycam. Their battery was compact, rechargeable, powerful, and crucially, free of unstable lithium metal. It was Sony who first coined the name lithium-ion and it stuck. But this wasn't just about one camcorder. Competing companies like Panasonic and Sanyo raced to catch up. Lithium-ion batteries started appearing in phones, CD players, laptops. Manufacturers actually began to advertise the use of lithium-ion batteries as a key selling point of their products. - I'm showing my age here. I joined the industry when lithium-ion cells were first introduced, and there was a Sony camcorder that was introduced, and then there was Dell computer. And I still remember the ads when Dell computer introduced their lithium-ion battery, and they had eight hours of runtime, so they had an advertisement in a magazine and it was eight pages long. Each one was an hour longer, so it was a big deal. - But what's crazy is that even after all this, these batteries should never have worked. See, when you charge the battery for the first time, lithium-ions move from the cathode to the graphite anode. And here, they react with the electrolyte to form this weird complex patchwork of compounds that build up on the anode's surface. These parasitic side reactions should keep going on indefinitely, using up all the lithium and destroying the cell but they don't. Instead they form a thin protective layer known as the solid electrolyte interface, or SEI. It's a kind of chemical shield protecting both the graphite anode and the electrolyte from further reactions. But crucially, lithium-ions can still slip through it. When the SEI originally forms during the first charging cycle, around 5% of the lithium in the cell actually gets stuck in this layer, decreasing the battery's capacity. But this little trade off is what makes the battery stable enough to be used for years or even decades, which is why today lithium-ion batteries are virtually everywhere. From 1991 to 2023, the price per kilowatt hour dropped by 99% from nearly $9,000 to just $100. At the same time, energy density and cycle life, how many times a battery can be charged and discharged before it wears out, improved dramatically, crossing a critical threshold. Lithium-ion batteries had become powerful enough and finally cheap enough for something bigger, the return of the electric car. Today, lithium-ion powers a $100 billion industry. In 2019, Whittingham, Goodenough and Yoshino finally received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for an invention that in the committee's words \"Revolutionized our way of life.\" This made Goodenough the oldest Nobel laureate in history, receiving the award at the age of 97. But lithium-ion isn't perfect. No text - Scary moments aboard a JetBlue plane, a fire erupting after a passenger's backpack suddenly exploded. - Every week, inside an airplane, there is at least one event of a battery, of a phone, of an iPad or a toy or something that catches fire. - What, every week? - Yeah, every week. - It's just the latest incident aboard a plane involving lithium-ion batteries. - [Reporter] So far this year, 60 onboard battery incidents through early October. - Every flight in the US has a bag, a specialized bag with very thick non-flammable materials where you put the phone inside, and you close it, and you still have a hazard and you have to deal with these gases, but now you have put the fire ignition away from anything else. And if it burst into fireworks, then at least it's in a container. And then you tell the captain, \"We need to land immediately.\" - [Derek] So what is actually happening when a battery fails like that? - This is a classic lithium-ion battery, and today we're gonna do something I always wanted to do. We're gonna tear one down. I guess safe to say don't do this at home. But what would happen if you were to do this outside of the gloved box? - If you charged up the cell and then you tried to tear it up, then you could accidentally short it, and then it could burn and it could even explode or fire. If you discharged it and you opened it up, you'd release all the different gases and really toxic chemicals, and if you inhale those, then you'd probably end up in hospitals. So at this point, we have what we call the jelly roll. So that's a roll off the cathode, separates that anode. - [Gregor] Yeah. - Stuck together with bit of tape. So Li Ren's just gonna scalpel off the tape, and then we should be able to unroll it into a nice sheet. - [Gregor] So these little patches are the electrolyte or? - Yeah. - Okay. - [Derek S.] So as time goes by, it'll start evaporating out. - That is so cool. It's so obvious when you see it, but I don't think anyone intuitively thinks that it's a rolled up like sheet of anode and cathode inside. But these layers inside the battery, they're not gonna stay perfect forever. Here's an electrode from a new cell compared to one from an old one. You can see that the lithium is building up in all of the wrong places, and if this sort of degradation gets out of hand, well, we're about to push the cell past its breaking point. How do we blow up a battery? - So today we've got a prismatic battery. No text It's a small battery from sort of a power tool or a phone or something similar. We're gonna wrap it in some nichrome wire, so we pass current through this wire. Something like 200 watts we pass through- - That's a lot. - This wire. Yeah, and it's a significant battery. We want it to go and we want it to go pretty spectacularly. (tense music) (scientists laughing) - [Gregor] Good luck, Harry. What we're simulating here is a catastrophic battery failure, the kind that could happen if a cell is damaged or overheated, or even just badly manufactured. It starts around 80 degrees Celsius when the protective SEI layer on the anode starts to break down. It's gonna try to reform, but these reactions are gonna release more heat, and if that heat can escape, the temperature is gonna keep rising. How close is it to exploding now? What do you think? - It should burst very soon. - Seconds. - [Gregor] At roughly 130 degrees Celsius, the polymer separator is gonna melt, and now the anode and cathode can come into direct contact, and a massive internal short follows. The cathode itself starts to decompose. And because transition metal oxides release oxygen from their crystal structure, they're gonna fuel the combustion, and now the fire is just feeding itself. Oh. - Yes! - Oh, oh my God. (dramatic music) That's really violent. This is insane, from one small battery like that. - And it's only 50% state of charge. - What we call ignition happens inside the battery, not outside the battery, and it requires a fuel or a substance that will undergo a reaction, it requires an oxidizer or the equivalent oxidizer and it requires heat. The battery contains these three inside, so it has its own equivalent to an oxidizer, its own equivalent to a fuel and its own source of heat. - Yeah. - All of it in one device. - So it's not actually lithium that burns. A modern lithium-ion battery like this one here contains very little lithium, ironically. It's actually everything else inside here that's dangerous. It must be really hard putting out a battery fire if it really has everything that it needs. - Yeah, exactly. So you can still put the blanket and stop the oxygen from arriving, but you will not, the fire will not go to zero. It will still, it will be smaller, but it will still be there. And then with water, yeah, water has the ability to take heat away, so it is possible to take the heat away from the battery with water. The best thing is to put and immerse the battery into a bath of water. - Yeah. - It's brutal. You can do it with one battery, with 10 batteries, with 15 batteries, but when you have very large packs of batteries with thousands of batteries, you cannot physically put that under water. - Yeah, one thing that is popping up recently as a threat to cities is electric car fires. - [Guillermo] Well, we know a lot of water works. - Yeah, well, if there's a water source nearby, I guess, yeah. - Yeah, I mean, this is what they do in some countries around the world. They have a truck, a specialist truck full of water, and you just take the car that has been involved in electric fire and they dump it into it. - No way. - Yeah, they do. But, and actually it works. - [Derek] So, how dangerous is it really? - It's very rare. Every million batteries, there is a fire. - Okay. - Right. So that's very safe, that in the standards of engineering, that's like, oh, you have a good system. One out of a million, that's fine. But batteries are everywhere. We don't even think about it. So within our lifetimes, we are going to reach a point where we would have been exposed to more than a million batteries, so we would be all of us experiencing a fire of a battery. - With billions of batteries in circulation, even rare failures become inevitable. Meanwhile, demand is skyrocketing. By 2030, we're projected to need over 17 million tons of battery grade materials, and making lithium-ion batteries comes at a cost. Lithium only makes up around 20 parts per million of Earth's crust. It's expensive and water intensive to extract, and 70% of cobalt, another key ingredient in many lithium-ion designs comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, much of it mined under hazardous, often exploitative conditions. We need more batteries and we need them fast. We can't just rely on lithium alone. - So it's not like lithium's as good as we're gonna get. Like that we're gonna get much better batteries in the future. If our priorities are about saving the planet from runaway climate change, we need to have massive scale energy storage system and electrify almost everything else that we do. - The hunt is still on for safer batteries, for cheaper ones, ones that last longer, charge faster, and ones that store far more energy. The lithium-ion battery changed the world, but the future of energy storage won't be about just conquering one element, it'll be about mastering many. (whooshing)"}]}

Do you think that most peopleare aware of the size, scale, utility of derivatives? No. No idea. But at its core, thisequation comes from physics, from discovering atoms, understanding how heat is transferred, and how to beat the casino at blackjack. So maybe it shouldn't be surprising that some of the bestto beat the stock market were not veteran traders, but physicists, scientists,and mathematicians. In 1988, a mathematicsprofessor named Jim Simons set up the Medallion Investment Fund, and every year for the next 30 years, the Medallion fund deliveredhigher returns than the market average, and not just by a little bit, it returned 66% per year. At that rate of growth, $100 invested in 1988 would be worth $8.4 billion today. This made Jim Simons easily the richest mathematician of all time. But being good at math doesn't guarantee successin financial markets. Just ask Isaac Newton. In 1720 Newton was 77 years old, and he was rich. He had made a lot of money working as a professor at Cambridge for decades, and he had a side hustle asthe Master of the Royal Mint. His net worth was \u00a330,000 the equivalent of $6 million today. Now, to grow his fortune,Newton invested in stocks. One of his big bets wason the South Sea Company. Their business was shipping enslaved Africans across the Atlantic. Business was booming and the share price grew rapidly. By April of 1720, the value ofNewton's shares had doubled. So he sold his stock. But the stock price kept going up and by June, Newton bought back in and he kept buying shareseven as the price peaked. When the price started tofall, Newton didn't sell. He bought more shares thinkinghe was buying the dip. But there was no rebound, and ultimately he lostaround a third of his wealth. When asked why he didn't seeit coming, Newton responded, \"I can calculate the motionsof the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.\" So what did Simons getright that Newton got wrong? Well, for one thing, Simons was able to stand on the shoulders of giants. The pioneer of using mathto model financial markets was Louis Bachelier, born in 1870. Both of his parents died when he was 18 and he had to take overhis father's wine business. He sold the business a few years later and moved to Paris to study physics, but he needed a job tosupport himself and his family and he found one at the Bourse, The Paris Stock Exchange. And inside was Newton's\"madness of people\" in its rawest form. Hundreds of traders screamingprices, making hand signals, and doing deals. The thing that capturedBachelier's interest were contracts known as options. The earliest known optionswere bought around 600 BC by the Greek philosopherThales of Miletus. He believed that the comingsummer would yield a bumper crop of olives. To make money off this idea, he could have purchased olive presses, which if you were right,would be in great demand, but he didn't have enoughmoney to buy the machines. So instead he went to all theexisting olive press owners and paid them a little bitof money to secure the option to rent their presses in thesummer for a specified price. When the harvest came,Thales was right, there were so many olives that the price of rentinga press skyrocketed. Thales paid the press ownerstheir pre-agreed price, and then he rented out themachines at a higher rate and pocketed the difference. Thales had executed thefirst known call option. A call option gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy something at a later date for a set price known as the strike price. You can also buy a put option,which gives you the right, but not the obligation to sell something at a later date for the strike price. Put options are useful if you expect the price to go down. Call options are useful ifyou expect the price to go up. For example, let's say the current price of Apple stock is a hundred dollars, but you expect it to go up. You could buy a call option for $10 that gives you the right,but not the obligation to buy Apple stock in oneyear for a hundred dollars. That is the strike price. Just a little side note, American options can be exercised on any date up to the expiry, whereas European optionsmust be exercised on the expiry date. To keep things simple, we'llstick to European options. So if in a year the price of Apple stock has gone up to $130, you can use the option to buy shares for a hundred dollars andthen immediately sell them for $130. After you take intoaccount the $10 you paid for the option, you've made a $20 profit. Alternatively, if in a year the stock prices dropped to $70, you just wouldn't use the option and you've lost the $10 you paid for it. So the profit and lossdiagram looks like this. If the stock price ends upbelow the strike price, you lose what you paid for the option. But if the stock price ishigher than the strike price, then you earn that differenceminus the cost of the option. There are at least threeadvantages of options. One is that it limits your downside. If you had bought thestock instead of the option and it went down to $70, you would've lost $30. And in theory, you couldhave lost a hundred if the stock went to zero. The second benefit isoptions provide leverage. If you had bought the stock and it went up to $130, then your investment grew by 30%. But if you had boughtthe option, you only had to put up $10. So your profit of $20 is actually a 200% return on investment. On the downside, if youhad owned the stock, your investment would'veonly dropped by 30%, whereas with the option you lose all 100%. So with options trading, there's a chance to make much larger profits, but also much bigger losses. The third benefit is youcan use options as a hedge. I think the originalmotivation for options was to figure out a way to reduce risk. And then of course, once people decided they wanted to buy insurance, that meant that there areother people out there that wanted to sell it or a profit, and that'show markets get created. So options can be an incredibly useful investing tool, but what Bachelier saw on thetrading floor was chaos, especially when it came tothe price of stock options. Even though they had beenaround for hundreds of years, no one had found a good way to price them. Traders would just bargainto come to an agreement about what the price should be. Given the option to buy orsell something in the future, it seems like a veryamorphous kind of a trade. And so coming up with prices for these rather strangeobjects has been a challenge that's plagued a number of economists and business people for centuries. Now, Bachelier, alreadyinterested in probability, thought there had to bea mathematical solution to this problem, and heproposed this as his PhD topic to his advisor Henri Poincar\u00e9. Looking into the math of finance wasn't really somethingpeople did back then, but to Bachelier'ssurprise, Poincar\u00e9 agreed. To accurately price an option, first you need to know what happens to stock prices over time. The price of a stock isbasically set by a tug of war between buyers and sellers. When more people wanna buya stock, the price goes up. When more people wanna sella stock, the price goes down. But the number of buyers and sellers can be influenced by almost anything, like the weather, politics, new competitors, innovation and so on. So Bachelier realized thatit's virtually impossible to predict all these factors accurately. So the best you can do is assume that at any point in time the stock price is just as likely to go up as down and therefore over the long term, stock prices follow arandom walk, moving up and down as if theirnext move is determined by the flip of a coin. Randomness is a hallmarkof an efficient market. By efficient economists typically mean that you can't make money by trading. The idea that you shouldn'tbe able to buy an asset and sell it immediatelyfor a profit is known as the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The more people try to make money by predicting the stock market and then trading on those predictions, the less predictable those prices are. If you and I could predict the stock market tomorrow, then we would do it. We would start trading today on stocks that we thought were gonna go up tomorrow. Well, if we did that, theninstead of going up tomorrow, they would go up now as we bought more and more of the stock. So the very act of predictingactually affects the quality of the future outcomes. And so in a totally efficient market, the prices tomorrowcan't possibly have any predictive power. If they did, we would'vetaken advantage of it today. This is a galton board. It's got rows of pegsarranged in a triangle and around 6,000 tiny ball bearings that I can pour through the pegs. Now, each time a ball hits a peg, there's a 50 50 chance itgoes to the left or the right. So each ball follows arandom walk as it passes through these pegs, which makes it basically impossible to predict the path ofany individual ball. But if I flip this over,what you can see is that all the balls together always create a predictable pattern. That is a collection of random walks creates a normal distribution. It's centered around the middle because the number ofpaths a ball could take to get here is the greatest. And the further out you go, the fewer the paths a ballcould take to get there. Like if you want to end uphere, well the ball would have to go left, left, left,left all the way down. So there's only one way to get here, but to get into the middle,there are thousands of paths that a ball could take. Now, Bachelier believed a stock price is just like a ball goingthrough a galton board. Each additional layer ofpegs represents a time step. So after a short time, thestock price could only move up or down a little, but after more time, a widerrange of prices is possible. According to Bachelier theexpected future price of a stock is described by a normal distribution, centered on the current price which spreads out over time. Bachelier realized he had rediscovered the exact equation which describes how heat radiates fromregions of high temperature to regions of low temperature. This was first discovered by Joseph Fourier back in 1822. So Bachelier called his discovery the radiation of probabilities. Since he was writing about finance, the physics communitydidn't take any notice, but the mathematics of therandom walk would go on to solve an almost centuryold mystery in physics. In 1827, Scottish botanist Robert Brownwas looking at pollen grains under the microscope, and he noticed that the particles suspended in water on the microscope slide were moving around randomly. Because he didn't knowwhether it was something to do with the pollen being living material, He tested non-organic particles such as dust from lava and meteorite rock. Again, he saw them movingaround in the same way. So Brown discovered that any particles, if they were small enough, exhibited this random movement, which came to be known as Brownian motion. But what caused it remained a mystery. 80 years later in 1905, Einstein figured out the answer. Over the previous couple hundred years, the idea that gases and liquids were made up of molecules became more and more popular. But not everyone was convinced that molecules were realin a physical sense. Just that the theory explaineda lot of observations. The idea led Einstein to hypothesize that Brownian motion is caused by the trillions of moleculeshitting the particle from every direction, every instant. Occasionally, more will hitfrom one side than the other, and the particle will momentarily jump. To derive the mathematics, Einstein supposed that asan observer we can't see or predict these collisionswith any certainty. So at any time we have toassume that the particle is just as likely to move in one direction as an another. So just like stock prices, microscopic particles move like a ball falling down a galton board, the expected location ofa particle is described by a normal distribution,which broadens with time. It's why even in completely still water, microscopic particles spread out. This is diffusion. By solving the Brownian motion mystery. Einstein had found definitive evidence that atoms and molecules exist. Of course, he had no idea that Bachelier haduncovered the random walk five years earlier. By the time Bachelier finished his PhD, he had finally figuredout a mathematical way to price an option. Remember that with a call option, if the future price of a stock is less than the strike price, then you lose the premiumpaid for the option. But if the stock price isgreater than the strike price, you pocket that difference and you make a net profitif the stock has gone up by more than you paid for the option. So the probability that an option buyer makes a profit is theprobability that the price increases by more thanthe price paid for it, which is the green shaded area. And the probability thatthe seller makes money is just the probability thatthe price stays low enough that the buyer doesn't earnmore than they paid for it. This is the red shadedarea. Multiplying the profit or loss by the probability of each outcome, Bachelier calculated theexpected return of an option. Now how much should it cost? If the price of an option is too high, no one will wanna buy it. Conversely, if the price is too low, everyone will want to buy it. Bachelier argued that the fair price is what makes the expected return for buyers and sellers equal. Both parties should stand togain or lose the same amount. That was Bachelier's insight into how to accurately price an option. When Bachelier finished histhesis, he had beaten Einstein to inventing the random walk and solved the problem thathad eluded options traders for hundreds of years. But no one noticed. The physicists were uninterested and traders weren't ready. The key thing missing was away to make a ton of money. Hey, so I'm not sure howstock traders sleep at night with billions of dollars riding on the madness of people, but I have been sleeping justfine, thanks to the sponsor of this video, Eight Sleep. I've recently moved to Australia and it has been really hot, but I've been keepingcool at night using the Eight Sleep Pod. It's a smart mattress cover that can control thetemperature of the bed and track how well you sleep. You can set the temperatureto whatever you like from around 13 degrees Celsius, all the way up to 43 degrees Celsius, and my wife likes it alittle warmer than I do, so it's useful that we can each have our own temperature onour own side of the bed. And if you don't knowwhat works best for you, well the Pod will learnyour ideal temperature and optimize it throughoutthe night using its autopilot. And usually that means gettinga couple of degrees cooler during the start of the night and then warming up in the morning to help you wake up. You can also have it wakeyou with a slight vibration, which is really pleasant and it doesn't disturb your partner like an annoying phone sound. You know, I've beentracking my sleep before and after using the Pod, and I've found that I'vebeen sleeping longer and waking up less since using the Pod. So if you wanna try it out for yourself, click on the link in the description and thanks again to Eight Sleep for sponsoring this part of the video. In the 1950s, a young physics graduate, EdThorpe, was doing his PhD in Los Angeles, but a few hours drive away, Las Vegas was quickly becoming the gambling capital of the world, and Thorpe saw a way to make a fortune. He headed to Vegas and satdown at the blackjack table, back then, the dealer onlyused a single deck of cards, so Thorpe could keep amental note of all the cards that had been played as he saw them. This allowed him to work out if he had an advantage. He would bet a bigger portion of his funds when the odds were in his favor and less when they weren't. He had invented card counting. This is a remarkable innovation, considering blackjack had been around in various forms for hundreds of years, and for a while thismade him a lot of money. But the casinos got wise to his strategy and they added more decksof cards to the game to reduce the benefit of card counting. So Thorpe took his winnings to what he called thebiggest casino on Earth: the stock market. He started a hedge fund that would go on to make a 20% return every year for 20 years, the best performanceever seen at that time. And he did it by transferringthe skills he honed at the blackjack tableto the stock market. Thorpe pioneered a type of hedging, a way to protect againstlosses with balancing or compensating transactions. Thorpe did it mathematically. He looked at the oddsof winning and losing and decided that under certainconditions you can actually tilt the odds in your favorby using certain patterns to be able to make bets. Suppose Bob sells Alicea call option on a stock, and let's say the stock has gone up, so now it's in the money for Alice. Well now for every additional$1, the stock price goes up, Bob will lose $1, but he can eliminate this riskby owning one unit of stock. Then if the price goes up, hewould lose $1 from the option but gain that dollar back from the stock. And if the stock drops backoutta the money for Alice, he sells the stock so he doesn't risk losingany money from that either. This is called dynamic hedging. It means Bob can make a profit with minimal risk fromfluctuating stock prices. A hedge portfolio pi at any one time will offset the option V with some amount of stock delta. It basically means Ican sell you something without having to take theopposite side of the trade. And the way to think about it is I have synthetically manufactured an option for you. I've created it out of nothing by doing dynamic trading. Dynamic hedging. As we saw with Bob'sexample delta, the amount of stock he has to hold, changes depending on current prices. Mathematically, it represents how much the current option price changes with a change in the stock price. But Thorpe wasn't satisfiedwith Bachelier's model for pricing options. I mean, for one thing, stockprices aren't entirely random. They can increase over timeif the business is doing well or fall if it isn't. Bachelier's model ignored this. So Thorpe came up witha more accurate model for pricing options, whichtook this drift into account. I actually figured out what this model was back in the middle of 1967, and I decided that I wouldjust use it for myself and then later I kept itquiet for my own investors. The idea was to basically make a lot of money out of it for everybody. His strategy was if theoption was going cheap, according to his model, buy it. If it was overvalued, short sell it, that is bet against it. And that way, more often than not, he would end up on thewinning side of the trade. This lasted until 1973. In that year, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes came up with an equation that changed the industry. Robert Merton independentlypublished his own version, which was based on the mathematicsof stochastic calculus, so he is also credited. I thought I'd have the field to myself, but unfortunately, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes published the idea and they did a better jobof the model than I did because they had very tight mathematics behind their derivation Like Bachelier, they thought that optionprices should offer a fair bet to both buyers and sellers, but their approach was totally new. They said if it was possible to construct a risk-freeportfolio of options and stocks just like Thorpe was doing with his delta hedging,then in an efficient market, a fair market, this portfolioshould return nothing more than the risk-free rate, what the same money would earn if invested in the safest asset, US treasury bonds. The assumption was thatif you're not taking on any additional risk, thenit shouldn't be possible to receive any extra returns. To describe how stockprices change over time, Black, Scholes, and Mertonused an improved version of Bachelier's model just like Thorpe. This says that at any timewe expect the stock price to move randomly, plus a general trendup or down, the drift. By combining these two equations,Black, Scholes, and Merton came up with the mostfamous equation in finance. It relates the price of anykind of contract to any asset, stocks, bonds, you name it. The same year theypublished this equation, the Chicago Board OptionsExchange was founded. Why is that equation so important? Like for finance, howdid that change the game? Well, because when you solve that partial differential equation, you get an explicit formulaof the price of the option as a function of a bunchof these input parameters. And for the very first time, you now have an explicit expression where you plug in the parameters and out pops this number so that people can actuallyuse it to trade on. This led to one of thefastest adoptions by industry of an academic idea in allof the social sciences. Within just a couple of years, the Black Scholes formula wasadopted as the benchmark for Wall Street for trading options. The exchange tradedoptions market has exploded and it's now a multi-trilliondollar industry, the volume in thismarket has been doubling roughly every five years. So this is the financialequivalent of Moore's Law. There are other businesses that have grown just as quickly, like credit default swaps market, the OTC derivatives market, the securitized debt market. All of these are multi-trilliondollar industries that in one form or another make use of the idea of Black Scholes Merton option pricing. This opened up a whole newway to hedge against anything, and not just for hedge funds. Nowadays, pretty much everylarge company, governments, and even individual investors use options to hedge against their own specific risks. Suppose you're running an airline and you're worried that anincrease in oil prices would eat into your profits. Well, using the BlackScholes Merton equation, there's a way to accurately and efficiently hedge that risk. You price an option tobuy something that tracks the price of oil, andthat option will pay off if oil prices go up, and that will help compensateyou for the higher cost of fuel you have to pay. So Black Scholes Mertoncan help reduce risk, but it can also provide leverage. An ongoing battlebetween bullish day traders and hedge fund short sellers that have bet against the stock, GameStop shares, have now risen some 700%. Well, GameStop is areally interesting example for all sorts of reasons, but options figuredprominently in that example because a small cadre of users on this Reddit sub-channelr/wallstreetbets decided that the hedge fund managers that were shorting the stock and betting that the companywould go out of business needed to be punished. And so they boughtshares of GameStop stock to try to drive up price. Turns out that buyingthe stock was not enough, because with a dollar's worth of cash, you can buy a dollar's worth of stock, but with a dollar's worthof cash, you can buy options that affected many more thana dollar's worth of stock, perhaps in some cases $10 or $20 worth of stock for adollar's worth of options. And so there's natural leverage embedded in these securities. And so the combinationof buying both the stock and the options caused theprices to rise very quickly. And what that did was to causethese hedge fund managers to lose a lot of money quickly. How big is this market for derivatives? How big is this whole area that kind of comes out of Black Scholes Merton? There are estimates of howlarge derivatives markets are, and first, let's be clearwhat a derivative is. A derivative is a financialsecurity whose value derived from another financial security. So an option is anexample of a derivative. In general, the size ofderivative markets globally is the on the order of several hundred trillion dollars. How does that compare to the size of the underlyingsecurities they're based on? It's multiples of theunderlying securities. I just have to interruptbecause it seems kind of crazy that you have more moneyriding on the things that are based on the thingthan the thing itself. That's right. So tell me how that makes any sense. Because what options allow you to do is to take the underlying thing and turn it into 5, 10, 20, 50 things. So these pieces of paper that we call options and derivatives, they basically allow us to create many, many different versions ofthe underlying asset, versions that individualsfind more palatable because of their ownrisk reward preferences. Does this make the markets and the global economy more stable, or less stable, or no effect? All three. So it turns outthat during normal times, these markets are a verysignificant source of liquidity and therefore stability. During abnormal times, by that I mean when there areperiods of market stress, all of these securitiescan go in one direction, typically down, and when they go down together, that creates a really big market crash. So in those circumstances, derivatives markets canexacerbate these kinds of market dislocations. In 1997, Merton and Scholes were awarded theNobel Prize in economics. Black was acknowledgedfor his contributions, but unfortunately he had passed away just two years earlier. We were gonna make alot of money in options, but now Black and Shoalshave told everybody what the secret is. With the option pricing formula now out for everyone to see hedge funds would needto discover better ways to find market inefficiencies. Enter Jim Simons. Before Simons had anyexposure to the stock market, he was a mathematician. His work on Riemann geometrywas instrumental in many areas of mathematics and physics,including knot theory, quantum field theory, andquantum computing Chern Simon's theory laid themathematical foundation for string theory. In 1976, the American MathematicalSociety presented him with the Oswald Veblen Prize in geometry. But at the top of his academiccareer, Simons went looking for a new challenge. When he founded RenaissanceTechnologies in 1978, his strategy was to use machine learning to find patterns in the stock market. Patterns provideopportunities to make money. The real thing was to gathera tremendous amount of data and we had to get it byhand in the early days, we went down to the Federal Reserve and copied interest ratehistories and stuff like that 'cause it didn't exist on computers. His rationale was that themarket is far too complex for anyone to be able to makepredictions with certainty. But Simons had worked for the US Institute for Defense Analysis during the Cold War,breaking Russian codes by extracting patternsfrom masses of data. Simons was convinced that a similar approachcould beat the market. He then used his academiccontacts to hire a bunch of the best scientists he could find. What was your employment criteria then? If they knew nothing about finance, what were you looking for in them? Someone with a PhD in physicsand who'd had five years out and had written a few good papers and was obviously asmart guy or in astronomy or in mathematics or in statistics. Someone who had donescience and done it well. It's not surprising that mathematicians and physicists are involved in this field. First of all, finance pays alot better than, you know, being an assistantprofessor of mathematics. And for a number ofmathematicians, the beauty of option pricing is equallycompelling to anything else that they're doing in their professions. One of these was Leonard Baum, a pioneer of Hidden Markov models. Just as Einstein realized that although we can't directly observe atoms, we can infer their existence through their effect on pollen grains, Hidden Markov models aim to find factors that are not directly observable, but do have an effecton what we can observe. And soon after that, Renaissance launched their now-famous Medallion fund. Using hidden Markov models and other data driven strategies, The Medallion fund becamethe highest returning investment fund of all time. This led Bradford Cornellof UCLA, in his paper Medallion Fund: TheUltimate Counterexample? to conclude that maybe theefficient market hypothesis itself is wrong. In 1988, I published a paper testing it, the US Stock Market, and what I found was thatthe hypothesis is false. You can actually rejectthe hypothesis in the data. And so there are predictabilities in the stock market. So it's possible to beat themarket is what you're saying. It's possible to beat themarket if you have the right models, the right training, the resources, the computational power, and so on and so forth, yes. The people who have found the patterns in the stock market, and the randomness for that matter, have often been physicistsand mathematicians, but their impact has gonebeyond just making them rich. By modeling market dynamics, they've provided new insight into risk and opened up whole new markets. They've determined what the accurate price of derivatives should be, and in doing so, they have helped eliminatemarket inefficiencies. Ironically, if we are ever able to discover all the patternsin the stock market, knowing what they are willallow us to eliminate them. Then we will finally havea perfectly efficient market where all price movementsare truly random."}]}
